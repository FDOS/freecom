Description of the special internal commands
	-- 2001/06/06 ska

=== Preface

FreeCOM uses execution contexts to keep track of when to continue execution
in what way. Instead of to create one context for each possible situation,
complex execution contexts may be splitted into smaller, simplier ones
using the generic 'C' (aka Command) contexts and this special command.

The special internal commands allow the user to modify internal settings, though, due to its nature
it is aimed to be used by FreeCOM itself rather than an human and provides
some "micro-script" capabilities as described below.

They are rather strict in their command line syntax and prompt errors with
a generic "syntax error" message.

=== Special Internal Commands

The following special internal commands are available:

ICMDS - enable/disable internal commands
IVAR - set/remove an internal variable
FD - replace a file descriptor with a saved one
ARG - set the %1-style arguments currently in effect

Although these commands behave like every other internal command, their
useage is mostly of internal nature and shouldn't be enabled by the
user.


=== ICMDS

Synopsis:
	ICMDS { [ '+' | '-' ] cmd }

Enables '+' or disables '-' the internal command 'cmd'.
It does not effect aliases.

Example:
C> ICMDS +icmds

Enables the ICMDS command itself. because it is disabled by default,
it is most probably to be called with:

C> ::=ICMDS +icmds

(see CMT3.TXT)

C> ICMDS -ECHO
disables the internal ECHO command.

=== IVAR

Synopsis:
	IVAR name [ '=' [ value ] 

As SET name=value, but the variable is storred in the current dynamic
context of the FreeCOM instance and is used by the command processor
in the execution contexts. The value can be retrieved with the variable
function %@IVAR[name].
If the equal sign is omitted, the variable is removed.

Special FOR variables are a hack that:
C> set adam=eva
C> FOR %a IN (*.*) DO echo %adam%
let the "%a" be interpreted as the current value FOR has aquired from
globbing *.*. Unlike normal variables, those FOR variables are not suffixed
by a precent sign.

In order to support to expand environment variables on interactive
command lines, too, special actions must be taken to ensure FOR
variables are expanded; therefore:

C> FOR %%%%%%%%%%%a IN (...) DO cmd

will accepted as valid, but requires that _exactly_ the same number of
percent signs are used within "cmd" to let the FOR hack kick in.

Multi-letter FOR variables are NOT effected by this hack, as they behave
exactly as normal environment variables.

Example:
If the command line parser hits the sequence:

%%%%adam

it tries to find a special FOR variable "%%%%a".
On success, all fice characters are replaced by the value.
On failure, the first two percent signs are substituted by a single
percent sign, as normal; then the parser tries to locate "%%a" a.s.o.

=== FD

Synopsis:
	FD num_JFT num_SFT

Closes the file descriptor "num_JFT", then assigns "num_SFT" to the
entry. Note: This is no dup() call!

This command is used to terminate redirections after an execution state
is popped.

=== ARG

Synopsis:
	ARG base_shift_level first_entry_to_remove shift_level


All arguments are continueously number from 0 (zero), including argument
%0 (the name of the batch file). All of them are stored into the dynamic
context with tag 6, the number is transformed into a four-digit
hexadecimal string and gets used as name.

The current argument %0 is referred to by the "base_shift_level", the 
actual string returned when expanding a "%#" variable is:
	base_shift_level + shift_level + #
where "shift_level" is the modified by the statement:
	SHIFT [ DOWN ]
.

The ARG command discards the argument pushed onto the argument stack,
e.g. when a batch file terminates. "base_shift_level" specifies the new
"base_shift_level" and "first_entry_to_remove" is the number of the
first argument entry to be removed, which was the current
base_shift_level most probably.


=== Example of how the special internal commands are used

1) Calling a batch script

C> CALL batch.bat arg1 arg2

process:
i) Because the batch file is invoked from command line, the current
ECHO status must be preserved, because an "ECHO OFF" does not effect
the command line, but subsequent scripts only.
Therefore a 'C' (aka Command) context is created to execute:
@::=ECHO ON
-or-
@::=ECHO OFF
respectively.

ii) CALL forces to create a new execution context that includes that,
when BATCH.BAT terminates, the currently effective arguments are to be
re-activated. Therefore, a new 'C' (aka Command) context is created to
execute the command:
@::=ARG
(because there are no arguments when a batch file is called from command
 line).

iii) then the command line is broken into its components, meaning into
argv[0] == batch.bat
argv[1] == arg1
argv[2] == arg2
The shift level is reset to zero as these are new arguments.
These stuff is installed as "argument currently in effect" within the
dynamic context tag \6.

iv) a 'B' (aka Batch) context is created, with the absolute filename and
the zeroed file position and line number.

v) the first line is read from the file and the postion and line number
are updated accordingly.

When the script terminates eventually, the B-context gets popped and
the next C-context gets current. It will execute the ARG command to
kill clear the %1-style arguments; then the next C-context is invoked,
which will reset the ECHO state to whatever the state was before.

If the script had been invoked from another script, the ECHO state is
not save, because it is to be persistent until the execution reaches
the interactive command line again; but the "@::=ARG" command will
have at least two arguments, the current shift level and the current
%0.

2) Executing pipes

A pipe is a compound command that associates two or more commands together
like this:

C> cmd1 <in | cmd2 | cmd3 | cmd4 ... >out

The input and output redirections are optional and may be located anywhere
on the command line; the listed postion above specifies where the redirection
is applied.

Because DOS is no multitasking system, the commands are not executed
simultaneously, but the pipes are simulated by files.

A simple pipe cmd1 | cmd2 can be simulated as:

cmd1 > tempfile
cmd2 < tempfile
DEL tempfile

And exactly this is done by the parser; then all commands are pushed
onto the stack in, of course, reversed order:

most current context
	C @::=IVAR 1=%@TEMPFILE
	C cmd1 <in >%@IVAR[1]
	C @::=IVAR 2=%@TEMPFILE
	C cmd2 <%@IVAR[1] >%@IVAR[2]
	C @::=DEL %@IVAR[1]
	C @::=IVAR 1
	C @::=IVAR 3=%@TEMPFILE
	C cmd3 <%@IVAR[2] >%@IVAR[3]
	C @::=DEL %@IVAR[2]
	C @::=IVAR 2
	C cmd4 <%@IVAR[3] >out
	C @::=DEL %@IVAR[3]
	C @::=IVAR 3
least current context

After creating all those contexts the executioner pops the most current
context, which is the C-context to assign the name of a temporary file
to the internal variable "1"; the next context is another C-context,
which then executes the -- probably external -- command "cmd1" with the
input redirection "in" and output redirection into the just generated
temporary file. a.s.o.

Because the commands themselves contain redirections, their execution
will temporarily create further execution contexts on the stack, see below.


3) Implementing redirections

A redirection is associates the in- or output of a command with a file
or device; once the command terminates, the original assocations must be
restored.

E.g.:

C> cmd <in >>out

associates the standard input stream (stdin, fd#0) with the file "in" and
the standard output stream (stdout, fd#1) with the file "out".

When such command is called from a batch file, e.g.:

C> batch.bat >out1

==BATCH.BAT
cmd <in2 >out2
echo Hallo
==

The output of "cmd" must be written into the file "out2", but ECHO is to
write into "out1".

The script is started as described in subsection "1)' above, by creating
a C-context with the current ECHO status, because the script is called from
the command line.

But instead of to create the next C-context with the @::=ARG command, 
the redirection ">out1" is applied as follows:
i) The output redirection changes file descriptor #2; therefore its
current association must be preserved. A new C-context is created with:
@::=FD 1 <#>
Where "1" is effected file descriptor and "<#>" is to represent whatever
SFT number is currently located at the entry #1 of the JFT.

ii) entry #1 of the JFT is overwritten with 255, indicating a closed (unused)
file descriptor. Note: The descriptor is _not_ closed via close(), so that
the currently opened file is kept open and in exactly the current state.

iii) File "out1" is opened in the requested mode (create if it does not
exist, truncate if it does). If the resulting file descriptor is different
that 1 (stdout), it is dupto()'ed there and the received one is closed.

Now the redirection is applied and all subsequent output operations will
write into this file.

current context stack:
top
	B abs_path_of_batch.bat,0,0
	C @::=ARG
	C @::=FD 1 old_SFT_item
	C @::=ECHO ON|OFF
lower end

Now the first line of the batch file is read and interpreted.
As it contains redirections as well, they are pushed onto the execution
stack:
top
	C @::=FD 1 old_SFT_item_from_fd1
	C @::=FD 0 old_SFT_item_from_fd0
	B abs_path_of_batch.bat,15,1
	C @::=ARG
	C @::=FD 1 old_SFT_item_from_fd1
	C @::=ECHO ON|OFF
lower end

Actually the topmost "old_SFT_item_from_fd1" is the value assoicated with
file "out1".
Note: The B-context now says: next line to be read from file position 15,
which is line number #2 ("1" == one line already read --> line #2 is next).

Once the external (or internal, doesn't actually matter) terminates,
the topmost C-context restores the output redirection back to "out1" a.s.o.

=== Internal Functions

The general syntax of internal functions is (EBNF-style):
	'%@' name [ '[' argument ']' | '(' argument ')' ]
There must be no whitespace between '%', '@', the name and the optional
argument.
The difference between the brackets and paranthesises is that the end of the
argument enclosed in parenthesises is always calcualted _before_ the
argument is expanded itself, e.g.:
	%@tempfile(%TEMP%)
will evaluate to the argument list:
	argv[0] == "@tempfile"
	argv[1] == current value of environment variable TEMP
	argv[2] == ""		(aka empty string)

Bracketed arguments do behave the same currently, but in the future the
variables are expanded before (or while) the right bracket is searched
for, e.g. the real argument list of:
	%@tempfile[%TEMP%]
varies with the acutal contents of the environment variable TEMP, e.g.:
	SET TEMP=arg] ahoi
It evaluates to:
	%@tempfile[arg] ahoi
which means:
	argv[0] == "@tempfile"
	argv[1] == "arg"
	argv[2] == ""		(aka empty string)
and the additional " ahoi" on the command line.

If no argument is specified, the internal function is called with
all arguments empty.
If an internal function uses sub-arguments, such as @tempfile, they
are delimited by the NLS list separator character, usually a comma ','
or semi-colon ';'. There must be no spurious whitespaces around the
sub-argument delimiter, e.g.
	%@tempfile(  .tmp)
would expand to:
	argv[0] = "@tempfile"
	argv[1] = "  .tmp"
	argv[2] = ""
So a temporary filename tried to be created would be, if %TEMP%==C:\TEMP:
	"C:\\TEMP\\CMD0000  .tmp"
Which will fail most probably.

=== @tempfile[ext,path]

Creates a temporary file in the directory <path> with the extension <ext>.
If no <path> is specified, %TEMP% is used. If no <ext> is specified, a
file with no extension is created. The file is created as a zero-length
file with the hidden-, system- and read-only attribute cleared.

The function returns the absolute filename.

=== @verbatim[string]....string

Ignores any percent characters between the @verbatim function and the
string or, if not found, the end of the command line. This function
prevents double expansion of the command line, e.g. when using the
FOR statement.

If <string> is empty, all the remaining line is effected.

=== @ivar[name]

Returns the contents of the internal variable <name>. An empty <name>
returns an empty string.
