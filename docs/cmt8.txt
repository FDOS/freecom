Internal representation of command lines
	-- 2001/04/26 ska

This document discusses the features and functionality of how
a command line is represented internally.

== The current implementation works best if all metacharacters are
   from the lower range 0..127. ==

Certain variants of processing the command line with storing them
back into an execution context, re-aquire them later, re-processing
them again, etc. a.s.o. may loose the information about what kind
of expansion has been already bestowed on certain parts of the command
line. Therefore the command line will be internally re-formatted to
hide already quoted characters and allow to embed special characters
and to embed the command strings into other ones, e.g. to store them
into the execution contexts.

The basic idea is to move all already parsed metacharacters from the
normal character set to ones not used normally, because the normal
command line mostly consits of characters >= ASCI(0x20) only, the
control characters seem to valunteer for this purpose, though, to
also embed those ones, the command line is transformed into a
multi-byte string.

Current meta-characters:
ASCI(0)..ASCI(32):	whitespaces, argument delimters, ...
<: input redirection
>: output redirection
|: pipes
%: variable expansion
,: argument separator
;: argument separator
=: argument separator
": quotation character

All these characters are located in the range 0..127, the lower range
of a byte.

The multibyte string uses lead characters to introduce multibyte
characters, all lead characters and all metacharacters are from the
range ASCI(1)..ASCI(31).

byte	meaning
\x01	lead byte, clear the highbit of the following character
\x02	lead byte, set the highbit of the following character     [A]

\x1e	string separator used to delimit strings in exec contexts
\x1f	pad byte, is removed from output string completely        [B]

[A] This lead byte has been introduced to "quote" characters of
    the higher range ASCI(128)..ASCI(255); to avoid confusion, the
    quoted characters already have the high bit set.
[B] Although this character is removed from the string when it is
    transformed into a string passed from the parser to the commands,
    they are characters within the parser, e.g.: a\x1fb effectively
    delimits the two tokens "a" and "b".
