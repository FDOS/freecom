Things to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~

(#) is the suggested priority, the lower the more urgent.



(0) Fix bugs :)

(2) Support the DOS=HIGH directive in CONFIG.SYS

(3) Optimize the code!  For size and speed.  There are numerous places
where the code is hardly optimal for either.

(1) Swap out when exec'ing? YES! Unless running from a floppy?

(1) Add wildcard support to REN.

(4) Add support for Win95 long filenames.

(1) Make the permanent command.com (/p) store the messages in memory
(this is already implemented) and have some way for other instances
of command.com to use these same messages in memory.  Maybe the
Multiplexor interrupt (2Fh)?  Does command.com have a MSDOS reserved
mux handler number?

(1) Critical Error handler: Conditions and rules must be defined
in which cases what action has to be done in order to prevent
accidently kill FreeCOM on INT-24. Some recover mechanism must be
implemented in hopeless situations, where the normal processing
can not proceed.

(2) Use all information available through DOS NLS API in all places
they apply to.
