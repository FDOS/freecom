FreeDOS Command Line Interface Development History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v0.85a
~~~~~
    regression fix: ensure not setting errorlevel for all internal commands, exclude commands such IF FOR etc
    documentation update - merge/remove duplicate files, add history, general updates (links, email, etc)
    correct help for 'for' command, add %% escaping to printf so for command shows %a ... do ... %a instead of ?a ... do ... ?a
    use program exit code as errorlevel when using loadfix or loadhigh (unless error invoking program)
    compatibility improvement, don't print % when missing paired % on command lines (show 'somevar' not '%somevar')
    add beginning of more comprehensive test batch file
v0.85
~~~~~
From Kenneth J Davis
    support CMDLINE for command lines > 126 characters when invoking COMMAND.COM
    improve compatibility when executing external programs - from RBIL and other sources, the command line should end in just \r and if greater than 126 chars, the size byte should be 127 not actual size; still keep \0 if command line is short enough but allow 126 chars without terminating \0, set size to 127 if >126
    misc batch file updates to aid in building multiple versions (languages/xmswap or not/compiler)
    support /E maxsize of 32768, FreeCOM documentation and MS/PC DOS command.com document max value as 32768, due to use of signed int FreeCOM max size was actually 32766; change argument processing to use unsigned int and support up to 32768 as argument
    git should ignore generated files
    add files to GitHub so http://www.fdos.org/freecom/ directs to GitHub hosted content
From Andrew Bird
    fix build due to language keyword in strings file got renamed
    improve fixstrs compatibility with gcc-ia16
    multiple build fixes for Linux due to case sensitive filenames
    muttiple fixes to avoid git encoding issues for translations
    slightly improved French translations from @cardpuncher
    fix so fixstrs does not segfault on incorrect input
    add the remaining translations to the CI build
    setup CI build on GitHub using GCC-ia16 and Open Watcom, multiple improvements to CI build
    remove duplicate translation the translation 'yu852' is identical to 'serbian' so remove it
    Update README - convert to Markdown, add build status badge, add links for Changes and Compile text documents
    fixstrs: Avoid sign extension of chars 128..255 - with GCC on Linux, cp850 char 0xa3 'ú' was being converted as 0xffffffa3, so be explicit about signedness and size of the parameter.
    fixstrs: fix invalid escape chars
    fixstrs: initialise version number, strupr should return the pointer passed in - fixes gcc warnings
    fixstrs: rename log variable - fix declaration mismatch
    build: Copy default file if config missing
From lpproj dbcs fork
    add nls fallback, fix for running on DOS kernels that lack the nls API used
    Add build option `upx' to build a compressed execuable
    alias watcom=wc in build script
    Fix chcp report wrong codepage on old DOS before v3.30 (and v3.30 for NEC PC-9800 series)
From p-durlej fork

    DIR: Fix DIR /O /W not putting newline before the summary.
    TYPE: Fix file open error handling
    TYPE: Fix partial read handling
    displayPrompt: prevent $P from being intermixed with INT 24H and phantom drive messages

    Allow non-permanent instances to exit with the last errorlevel instead of zero.

v0.84pre7
~~~~~~~~~
fix: Check for Win64 in Watcom makefile via %ProgramFiles(x86) (Bart)
chg: Build xms-swap by default (Bart)
fix: Use -fno-builtin for GCC to use libc/overridden functions everywhere (Bart)
chg: Use -mregparmcall for GCC. Needs adjustment of intr() prototype
     (still stdcall) (Bart)
chg: Add linker script command.ld so relocations can be used in NASM code
     for GCC via _TEXTSEG. (Bart)
fix: Force 8086-asm; use direct call far real_XMSexec instead of push/push/retf.
     Fixes #15 (Bart)
fix: Move termination hook into seperate file and always use independent of XMS.
     Closes #16 (Bart)
fix: Fix loadhigh failure when zero-byte free memory block is exist
     (Sava, lpproj)
fix: Allow escape of > < | via ^> ^< and ^|. Fixes #12. (Bart)
fix: Fix build break on msys2 (with *-mingw32-gcc and ia16-elf-gcc)
     (Sava,lpproj)
fix: LH/LOADFIX call execute instead of exec and skip bat files. Fixes #8.
     (Bart)
fix: LOADFIX: stop manipulating UMB link, use first fit>0x10000. Fixes #10.
     (Bart)
fix: dosGetUMBLinkState needs to return state in _AL, not _AX (see #10)
     (Bart)
fix: Avoid possible NULL dereference in dprintf. Fixes #9 (Bart)
fix: XMScopy needs to be declared noinline for GCC to work correctly. (Bart)
fix: Fix "copy con file" where file already exists. (Bart)
     We need to use devopen instead of dfnstat to check for src existence.
fix: Create and use sfn_creat() for dos_creatnew() redone.
     Also rename dos_creatnew() to sfn_creatnew().
     Using creat instead of creatnew for file creation avoids
     the need for truncation using write(), and the handle can
     be directly used without needing to reopen the file.
     However, differently from the previous try, LFNs are still reopened for
     compatibility with Windows 2000/XP. (Bart)
fix: dos_read and dos_write now call farread/write for all compilers.
     This is more consistent and fixes truncating writes for GCC. (Bart)
fix: Fix lfnmkdir to really create LFNs; easiest to separate out. (Bart)
fix: Don't use expensive open/close to check for SFN.
     Instead use the boolean, then put in extra check to see if
     int21/ax=7160 works. (Bart)
fix: Add stack checking, adapted from Tom Ehlert (Bart)
fix: Save another 520 bytes of stack by reusing buffers where safe. (Bart)
fix: myfnsplit(): use common buffer to store dir/name/ext to save stack space.
     This saves ~1250 bytes of stack and eliminates stack overflows in the
     ke2041 test in metados. (Bart)
chg: Generate 28.com and 50.com from assembly language. (Bart)

v0.84pre6
~~~~~~~~~
fix: Revert to first-fit dosalloc for copy&dir buffers for non-large model
     (Bart)
fix: Enable reporting of directory sizes up to 2TB (with Tom Ehlert)
fix: dosalloc: apply carry to flag image for intr(), not directly via stc
     The carry flag was not preserved before. (Bart)
fix: Use intr.asm with OW too, to be able to use SZAPC flags on input. (Bart)
chg: Enable cross-compilation from 64-bit Windows using Open Watcom (Bart)
fix: ia16-elf-gcc: intr( ) now loads flags before invoking interrupt (TK Chia)
fix: compilation errors when LFN is disabled. Fixes #5. (Bart)
fix: Allocate a large enough buffer for the rest of the command line.
     We need to use a full buffer for the rest to allow for alias expansion.
     Fixes #6. (Bart)
fix: GCC: make sure that XMS calls get ds:si, otherwise ds can be wrong. (Bart)
fix: OW: Use xmsfunc typedef and apply #pragma aux to that.
     This way XMScopy actually works, and passes the structure in si,
     so messages are copied correctly. Fixes issues with metados. (Bart)
fix: keep asm inputs & clobbers separate in gcc port of dup2 (TK Chia)
fix: ia16-elf-gcc code wrongly assumed XMS driver preserves %bx (TK Chia)
fix: tell OW that bx/cx can be modified, similar to ia16-elf-gcc (Bart)
fix: cmd: shift: use correct context, Fixes SF Bug #155 (Wolfram Sang)
chg: Replace XMSrequest external asm with inline asm for GCC. (Bart)

v0.84pre5
~~~~~~~~~
add: Serbian/Yugoslavian for cp852 from freedoslocal (Dejan Strbac)
add: Slovenian translations from freedoslocal (Matej Horvat)
add: Turkish translations from freedoslocal.
fix: Update French translations from freedoslocal (Mateusz Viste)
fix: [bugs:#192] FOR %i IN (*.*) do @ECHO %i does not work
fix: [bugs:#209] The shell doesn't display any error if exec fails.
     It will now say "EXE file corrupt" if the .exe file has a bogus header.
chg: Reduce ifdef's for GCC, using new ia16-elf-gcc functionality.
chg: Use cglobal and cextern macros in asm files for globals.
fix: Use last-fit dosalloc for copy&dir buffers to work well with large model
fix: Plug memory leak in and around comResFile().
fix: _dos_allocmem takes a pointer to unsigned, not unsigned long.
fix: Wrap dprintf macro into do { ... } while (0);
fix: Use only libc stdio in DEBUG build, not printf from clib.
chg: Remove no longer used tempfile/rmtmpfile.
fix: cgetchar_timed and eliminate its call to fputmc.
chg: Replace fputmc calls by more direct memset/dos_write calls.
fix: non-small (debug) model compilations for Turbo/Borland.
chg: Compile debug version in medium memory model instead of large.
fix: debug version (large model); enable for watcom.
chg: Create and use sfn_creat() and use instead of dos_creatnew()
fix: lfn_creat needs to truncate files that already exist.
fix: hang for batchfiles that do not end with an EOL character.
     This fixes a hang with Rugxulo's metados.img.

v0.84pre4
~~~~~~~~~
fix: spelling, by Anders Jonsson <anders.jonsson@norsjovallen.se>
fix: Edits to Swedish translation file, by Anders Jonsson
fix: Make echolib.bat compatible with cmd.exe (Tom Ehlert)
fix: Fix build for GCC-compiled load_icd.exe (Bart)
fix: parsefnm failures and cleanup other inline asm for OW and GCC (Bart)
fix: revert change keeping context alwyas on heap (caused out-of-memory) (Bart)
fix: replace use of inline asm lcall/call for GCC with plain C calls (Bart)

v0.84pre3
~~~~~~~~~
fix: Make sure that ds=ss in XMSexec call (Bart)
The newest ia16-elf-gcc floats ds inside functions and with the inline
asm doesn't know it's a function call (Bart)
chg: fmemcpy now compiles properly with ia16-elf-gcc (remove workaround) (Bart)
chg: Use GNU Make instead of OW wmake to compile with ia16-elf-gcc (Bart)
chg: Build strings without needing to create/remove the subdirectory (Bart)
chg: Move xmssave and some related variables to near transient data
This is possible since the resident code no longer references those
Be careful to not write to any transient data after the save to XMS (Bart)
chg: Fix "TODO make XMSsave two structures in order to drop this subroutine"
(Bart)
chg: Make XMSexec function near and move 80 resident code bytes to transient
section. (Bart)
chg: fix xms-swap TODO: first_time either 04ah or 049h --> no jumps (Bart)
chg: xms-swap: move residentCS from cs: to ds: (Bart)
fix: Stack size for OW needs to be 4K instead of default 2K.
This matches Turbo C's default, and allows for some large stack
users with LFNs. (Bart)
chg: Reduce heap memory by only keeping the necessary rest of the command line.
(Bart)
chg: Keep the context permanently on the heap via realloc, to reduce
fragmentation. (Bart)
chg: Properly patch the heap size for Open Watcom
The memory layout for OW is different from Turbo C.
For Turbo, heap is below stack, but for OW it's the reverse.
Hence OW keeps the data segment much more minimal by default.
There is however a default sbrk increment of 8096 set by
_amblksiz. If we set that to 6K instead the heap will stay
at that size, so TSRs are loaded beyond that point
(for non-XMS-SWAP that is, with XMS-SWAP it's completely
different) (Bart)
chg: getEnv: remove static pointers, caller responsible for free.
Eliminating the 3-pointer dance and free-ing the environment
variable pointer as soon as possible reduces heap fragmentation. (Bart)
fix: Fix farwrite and hence copy for Turbo/GCC (Bart)
fix: "dir" output for dates with our own printf. It supports %02u but not %.2u.
Those produce the same result though (Bart)
chg: port to ia16-elf-gcc (Bart)
fix: kswap_p is a _seg * pointer so we need MK_SEG_PTR for compilers without
_seg (Turbo C 2.01, OW). Otherwise the critical error handler is not installed
correctly for non-xms-swap builds. (Bart)
chg: Use "add si, byte 10" so old and new NASM generate the same opcodes (Bart)
fix: Use proper prototypes on enum{File}Resources callback function (Bart)
chg: allow Linux cross-compilation, port build utils to GCC-Linux (Bart)
fix: Fix ren for files without extensions (passes NULL ptr for ext) (Bart)
fix: Fix LOADHIGH for compilers without _seg pointers. Use FP_SEG
instead of casting the pointer to unsigned, as _seg is defined to far on
compilers without _seg (e.g. Watcom) (Bart)
fix: IF EXIST should auto-fail critical errors due to empty drive (Tom & Jeremy)
add: %CD% as alternative to %_CWD% (Tom)
fix: Use screen height 25 when 0 returned as current height, from Mateusz
Viste, bug #131 see http://sourceforge.net/p/freedos/bugs/131/ (Jeremy)
chg: Merged fcompl1 and fcompl2.c to filecomp.c (Bart)
chg: Untangle findfirst/next/close definitions to make them more explicit (Bart)
chg: Consistently use dos_open/dos_close/dos_read/dos_write, etc
The problem with _open, _read, etc. is that they mean different things
to Turbo than for OW: Turbo _open is like _dos_open but OW _open is an
alias for open (Bart)
chg: Eliminate open() in favor of _open/_creat/dos_creatnew (Bart)
chg: Eliminate fgets(), replacing with _read() (Bart)
chg: Use backspaces instead of gotoxy calls to clear a command line (Bart)
chg: Use _write for all printf style writes in prf.c and for putc(har).
Remove fflush and setbuf calls (Bart)
chg: Eliminate fputs everywhere except for prf.c (Bart)
chg: Eliminate read() by using _read() everywhere (Bart)
chg: Remove references to fopen / fcloseall for non-debug builds (Bart)
chg: Use open/read/close instead of fopen/fread/fclose everywhere (Bart)
fix: EnumFileResources function arguments to all use handles instead of
streams (Bart)
fix: Fix loadModule: it should use an int fd for a handle instead of a FILE *.
(Bart)
chg: replaced all text mode write()s by binary _write()s to save RTL usage
space (Bart)
chg: farread/farwrite cleanup of DOS r/w's (Bart)
chg: Use handle I/O instead of stream I/O for resources to save space (Bart)
chg: Change geninterrupt emulation to use intr() instead of int86x() for
consistency (Bart)
chg: Centralize LFN functions for mkdir/rmdir/chdir (Bart)
fix: Support precision flag and size/precision from argument list in abbreviated
printf function, to fix "dir /lfn" (Bart)
fix: Don't truncate when not necessary for LFN opens. Works around an FD kernel
bug were truncating a 0-byte file caused an error (Bart).
fix: "copy con file" (Bart)
fix: COPY: trailing /a and /b options only apply to the last (destination)
file, not globally, when concatenating, "/a" is the default. (Bart)
chg: Replace stream i/o for COPY by simpler handle i/o, so fileno doesn't need
to be used all the time.  (Bart)
chg: Use BIGcopy() for both ascii and binary copies. ASCII just means to check
for Ctrl-Z, don't mess with line endings, so do that manually using fmemchr.
When eof is detected, no more reads are needed. (Bart)
fix: COPY: The /B switch should switch devices to raw mode (see nansi.sys
documentation). Fix errors given for "copy [/a|/b] file.txt con".  (Bart)
chg: Use small printf() from the kernel source with a few modifications to do
some buffering. Saves 3.5K in RTL code for OW. (Bart)
fix: exit() needs to be overriden for OpenWatcom as well as Turbo C. (Bart)
fix: Fix direct _seg pointer casts for Open Watcom (and also Turbo C 2.01)(Bart)
fix: Fix size of LFN in struct locffblk, and make sure the ffblk structs are
packed (Bart)
fix: Fix devopen in OW using stdarg.h and proper prototypes (Bart)
fix: Fix xms-swap for Open Watcom (Bart)
fix: Set stdout to unbuffered for Watcom as it is by default for Turbo C (Bart)
fix: Use stdarg.h to avoid messing with prototypes in, and fixing Open Watcom'
use of env_replace (Bart)
fix: Update build system to support Open Watcom. Introduce config.b/config.bat
like in the kernel source to be able to configure make/wmake locations (Bart)
fix: ISR/dir.h/stpcpy/string/?etverify/parsfnm related changes for OW
compatibility (Bart)
chg: Use IREGS/intrpt instead of struct REGPACK/intr everywhere for OW
compatibility. Similarly, USEREGS simulates geninterrupt (Bart)
fix: Avoid Turbo C specific use of sizeof in preprocessor expressions (Bart)
fix: Adjust makefiles to be compatible with TC 2.01's very limited MAKE utility
(no redirection) (Bart)
fix: Fix compiler warnings (Bart)
chg: Handle .obj dependencies for suppl instead of rebuilding every time (Bart)
chg: Prune unused files from stripped-down suppl (Bart)
chg: Remove duplicate .h files from suppl source (Bart)
fix: Do not compare (signed) to ' ' but use iscntrl() - otherwise,
FIXSTRS may chop trailing non-ASCII (eg Russian) words away (Eric Auer).
fix: Fixed compilation completely with Turbo C (Blair).
fix: Got rid of all '//' comments (Blair)
fix: Support for BC (Blair)
fix: Fix for compiler oddities (Arkady).
fix: Fixed bug in Truename (Blair).
fix: Print long filename current directory (Blair).
fix: Use safer intr routine rather than directly modify registers (Blair).
fix: Moved lfnsup to a place where it will not be overwritten (Blair).
add: Add option to compile to support switch character instead of hardcoded '/'
(Blair)
add: The new SET /E feature. (Blair)
fix: Fixed long filename handling in DIR. (Blair)
fix: COPY uses static-size buffers now to prevent known problems with dynamic
allocation. (Blair)
fix: Improved PATH handling routine (Arkady).
fix: Fixed (hopefully) bug in %PATH% parsing routing and A:/B: random accessing bug (Blair).
fix: Fixed bug where a directory could be found in %PATH% parsing (Blair).
chg: Added Polish translation, updated French&Italian translation (Blair).
chg: Made RD/MD/CD more buggy-lfn-implementation friendly (Blair).
chg: Removed usage of CLIB perror function and reduced executable size by nearly
1 kb.  Since perror was only used in ren and del, and only two possible errnos
exist, the function can be minimized, and also as an added advantage, the
errors that were printed can now be translated (Blair).

  add: command line scanner acts over both internal command lines and
  	arguments of COMMAND.COM itself ==> added longname options

29-Apr-1999 0.77 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o dir.c: changed dir so it always shows the bytes free.
  Changed so that "dir command" with no extension will do as
  "dir command.*" (as it should).  Also made the display of the directory
  not include the whole filespec, but only the directory
o copy.c: Now works if dest is just a drive letter.
  (i.e "copy file a:")

25-Apr-1999 0.77 Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bugfix: alias.c: aliasexpand(): The main loop is multiply executed, if
	at least one alias was expanded (controlled by variable 'd').
	However, because 'ptr' is never resetted, the second loop
	always immediately fails, because 'ptr' is still NULL.
bugfix: batch.c: batch_params(): Copying a quoted argument: If the string
	is not terminated, the do-while loop stops, then copies the '\0'
	byte, then increments s2 --> s2 now behind the string.
bugfix: batch.c: batch(): fullname is duplicated into heap, but
	not freed if this function fails
bugfix: batch.c: batch(): no error checking of batch_params()
add: cmdinput.c: readcommand(): ^C: as ESC, also sets ECHO to ON
bugfix: copy.c: cmd_copy(): If malloc of sources fails, 'p' is not freed
bugfix: dir.c: cmd_dir(): dircmd can be NULL
bugfix: filecomp.c: complete_filename(): makelower undefined if count < 0
bugfix: for.c: cmd_for(): missing out-of-memory check with batch_params()
bugfix: goto.c: cmd_goto(): leave the current FOR contexts
add: command.h/misc.c: match(), matchtok(), match_() test if a word
	begins a line, if so, skip over it and following spaces
add: misc.c: comFile(): returns the absolute filename of COMMAND.COM
add: misc.c: comPathFile(): returns the name of a file located in the
	directory as COMMAND.COM
chg: init.c: ComDir: replaced by ComPath, comFile() & comPathFile()
fix: init.c: initialize(): combination of "/p" and "/c"|"/k" did not work
bugfix: command.c: process_input(): FOR hack: On command line one can
	enter "FOR %a IN () DO ...". The current implementation expanded
	the %A's.
chg: alias.c: ltrim() & rtrim() moved to MISC.C, all "skip whitespace"
	code pieces use these functions now
add: misc.c: trim(): combination of rtrim() & ltrim()
add: assert()'s to every function

24-Mar-1999 0.77 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added support for swapable exec.  There is a compile-time directive
  so you can leave it out, or use it.  IT DOES NOT WORK UNDER
  FREEDOS.  Probably a kernel problem, but that has not been
  determined yet.
o changed the way we run autoexec.bat or a batch file on the command
  line.  This seemed to clear up some bugs with running autoexec.bat.
o Changed set command so you can use a space between the variable and
  the value.  Prints Syntax error if you don't have a space or a '='.

24-Mar-1999 0.76b Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o date.c: bugfix: detection for invalid date strings.
   Now the whole string must match: ^\s*\d+(.(\d+(.\d*)?)?)?\s*$
   The numbers can be delimited by any character from the 7-bit ASCII set,
   which is printable, but not alphanumerical.
   One need not specify all three parts (in which case the delimiter
   may be omitted, too). If one specify;
     1 number --> only the day changes
     2 numbers --> month/day; year remains unchanged
     3 numbers --> month/day/year
o time.c: bugfix: Detection of invalid time strings
   One can specify:
     ^\s*\d+.\d+(.(\d+(.\d*)?)?)?\s*([aApP]([mM]|\.[mM]\.)?\s*$
   If one specifies:
     1 number --> error
     2 numbers --> hour:minute, seconds & hundreds default to zero
     3 numbers --> hour:minute:seconds, hundreds defaults to zero
     4 numbers --> hour:minute:seconds.hundreds
   The numbers may be delimited by any character from the 7-bit ASCII set,
   which is printable, but not alphanumerical.
o err_hand.c: bugfix: Print garbage on screen, if no disk in floppy
    drive An "interrupt" function saves & restores all registers and
    also sets up DS correctly.
o created parsenum.c

11-Feb-1999 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o command.c: changed the spawnl call back to using the exec function.
  Now that we are handling the environment correctly, this seems to
  work better.  It passes new environment variables (even ones that
  were created by this copy of command.com) to the child process.
  This was suggested by Steffen Kaiser.
o using keypressed() that I wrote instead of Turbo C's kbhit()
  function because for some reason kbhit() hangs under the FreeDOS
  kernel.
o prints seconds as it waits for a keypress from user (during initial
  boot)
o Fixed path to autoexec.bat.
o Changed openStrFile() function to try to read the strings from the
  end of command first, and then to try to read strings.dat in the
  same directory as command.com.  This helps when running from the
  debugger.

01-Feb-1999 0.76 Rob Linwood <rcl@udel.edu>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: added code to allow alias commands to contain extra
  whitespace
o added "?" command that shows the available commands.


31-Jan-1999 0.76 (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o dir.c: Changed dir_print_header to use function INT21,AH=69 instead
  of the function it was using.  I'm not sure if this will fix
  anything or not.  Also fixed bug with changing and restoring the
  current drive.
o ver.c: changed /r to identify the FreeDOS kernel.  If you are using
  kernel build 2000 or greater, it also shows the kernel version!
o init.c: when command.com is started, it shows how much memory
  command.com is not hogging!  Hopefully this will increase soon!


28-Jan-1999 0.75i (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: Changed noalias character from a dot to an asterisk (*).


25-Jan-1999 0.75i Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o This patch includes the CP/M style device name support:
o Changed any open() and fopen() calls, when definitely sure that
  they are called for disk files only, into devopen() and fdevopen().
o Support for COPY is a hack. Rob or John should double check it, or
  possibly rewrite the whole file. (Thanx Steffen! - John :-)
  Changes in COPY.C:
  bugfix: setting time in ASCII mode before writing final ^Z
  bugfix: copy(): if bsiz < 128: the opened files are not closed
  chg: all error "return" statements perform the actions in the
       same sequence to allow the code optimizer to re-use code
  add: support for CP/M style device names (openf.h)
  chg/bugfix: overwrite(): use vcgetcstr(); could overflow the buffer
  chg: there were two individual flags ASCII and BINARY to indicate
       which option was specified. Internally only the ASCII flag was
       used, if it was clear, the files were copied in binary mode.
       To support devices the two flags are passed unchanged to the
       copy() function and, if both are clear (== none specified on
       command line), it defaults to ASCII for devices, but will not
       append the ^Z character.
       Due to this, the destination file must be opened in ASCII
       mode, too; otherwise the newline character had to be handled
       manually.
o Two new files: openf.c & openf.h


25-Jan-1999 0.75i Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o This patch addresses the two bugs reported by Eric Kohl
  <ekohl@abo.rhein-zeitung.de>:
o alias.c: aliasdel(): accesses dynamic memory after it was free()'ed.
o split()'s code to skip leading whitespaces crashes at end of string.

22-Jan-1999 0.75i Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o bugfix: on suggestion of Charles Dye (raster@highfiber.com)
  "/ccommand" "/c" must work without a space between [MS COMMAND
  compatibly] also mimics: "/c/? dir" --> bad command or filename

o add: DR DOS compatibly: "/c:" and "/c=" even supports wierd
    looking: "/c:dir/?"

o add: DR DOS compatibly: "/p:AUTOEXEC_replacement"

o sub: calling _fullpath() for ComDir; at this point the path must be
  fully-qualtifed by convention of the environ

16-Dec-1998 0.75h (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: Changed so that a dot before a command will disable alias
  expansion.  I was "noalias" but I prefer the shorter solution.

16-Dec-1998 0.75h Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o bugfix in init() for the /C branch (collecting arguments)
o tracemode interaction in parsecommandline()
o vcgetcstr() to fetch a visible user input, incl. validation check
o command line parsing now exactly as the help screen (strings.txt)
  describes
o show help screen using display_string()
o set exitflag (and exit if allowed) if help screen was issued or a
  bad option was found
o load messages into conventional far memory
o change in message.c that string_index is not allocated dynamically
o The "load messages into memory" feature allocates the block the
  messages are read into using the DOS API. It is not guarranteed
  that this block is freed by DOS upon termination of the program,
  therefore the atexit() function (installed by init()) explicitly
  frees the block, because it seems to be the best (and most secure)
  place to do so.
o is designed to work for a file STRINGS.DAT *less* than 64KB only!
o bugfix: preserve ECHO state of interactive command line (see
  TEST1.BAT)
o bugfix with infinite loop in aliasexpand() when the useFlag warps

04-Dec-1998 0.75g Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o changed dosalloc.c in the suppl library to fix the environment
  problem.

03-Dec-1998 0.75f (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o alias.c: changed to convert to lower case instead of upper
o cls.c: cls now sets the text colors to lightgray on black before
  clearing the screen.
o command.c: Added code to remove white space from end of command in
  docommand function.  Also added nextcmd char pointer so we don't
  loose the other commands in the line.  This fixes the bug
  with "type filename.c | more"
o dir.c: Rewrote DIR command.  fixed problem with "DIR .COM" and
  other bugs. Recursive switch does not work now, but it will be
  added soon.
o init.c: finished batch file trace mode.  Fixed bug with /C command
  line switch running batch files.
  Added about 2 second delay where user can press F8 to run
  autoexec.bat in tracemode, or press F5 to bypass autoexec.bat
  completely.
o messages.c: Reduced the ammount of memory allocated by not reading
  in entire index, but only the index element needed.

27-Oct-1998 0.75e Rob Green <robg@sundial.net>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o command.c: changed line in is_delim function to include backslash
  and period.

27-Oct-1998 0.75e Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o bugfix: cmd_del(): Prompting the user for "DEL ab*.*"
o chg: display_string(): Invalid FreeDOS ID is not displayed on screen
o chg: get_redirection(): join '|'-loop with the other loop
o chg: get_redirection(): allocate filenames (instead of
  parsecommand())
o bugfix: get_redirection(): Missing closing quote
o bugfix: parsecommandline(): replace tmpnam() by tmpfn() to ensure
  that the temporary file is placed into the temporary directory
  instead of the current one
o chg: alias.c: to reflect changes in tempfile.c
o chg: rmtmpfile(): to close file pointer
o chg: tempfile(): to use tmpfn()
o add: tmpfn(): to create a temporary filename

13-Sep-1998 0.75d (Hans B Pufal <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o added an icon for the program.  fdcom.ico.

13-Sep-1998 0.75d (John P. Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o added VOL command.
o fixed a couple of bugs in the COPY command.
o move nearly all messages to external file that is appended to end
  of command.com.  command.com is now an EXE type program, but has
  only been renamed to .COM.  This allowed the file to be longger
  than 64K.  Also changed model to small instead of tiny.
o changed VER to print system info when /R is used.  /D shows
  redistribution info now.

13-Sep-1998 0.75d Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Corrected/rewrote ^Break handling to work on external commands.

13-Sep-1998 0.75d (Rob Lake <rlake@cs.mun.ca>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o added COPY command.  Not all functionality is implemented yet, but
  it's a great start!

10-Aug-1998 0.75b Steffen Kaiser <skaise2a@smail.inf.fh-rhein-sieg.de>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Corrected ^Break handling in batch.c.  If one batch file (BATCH1)
  calls another (BATCH2), pressing ^Break or ^C most of the time asks
  to terminate BATCH1.BAT (Y/N/A). If you press 'Y', you should only
  terminate BATCH1, but BATCH2 should continue.  But if you press 'A'
  (or ^C), all batch files should terminate.
o added modifyable batch scripts (following the standard).
o bug: nested comments in old split()
o bug: DEL memory allocation
o added ^Break checks to cmd_type(), cmd_dir()
o added: chkCBreak(0) [aka "cbreak"] is a generic form that
  autodetects if currently a batchfile is active and displays the
  batchfile prompt, if so.  The batchfile prompt now displays the
  name of the batchfile.

09-Aug-1998 0.75a (Rob Lake <rlake@cs.mun.ca>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o dir.c: fixed bug that caused blank lines to be printed
o dir.c: renamed _Read_Dir to Read_Dir
o del.c: changed check for ^C
o del.c: alloced mem for char **arg
o misc.c: changed split function
o misc.c: added freep function
o truename.c: _truename now sets errno
o created build.bat

07-Aug-1998 0.75 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed carrage return output to better match MSDOS with echo on or off.

04-Aug-1998 (Hans B Pufal) <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o call.c: added lines to initialize for pointers.  This fixed the
  lock-up that happened sometimes when calling a batch file from
  another batch file.

02-Aug-1998 (Hans B Pufal) <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o batch.c: Fixed bug in ECHO flag restoration at exit from batch file
o command.c: Fixed return value when called with /C option
o Terminate label on first space character, use only first 8 chars of
  label string

30-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug where if you typed something, then hit HOME, then tried to
  type something else in insert mode, it locked up.
o Changed default insert mode to on.  There should be a way to change
  this.  Maybe options to doskey command.
o Added VERIFY command

30-Jul-1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Changed filename completion so that a second TAB displays a list of
  matching filenames!
o made filename be lower case if last character typed is lower case.
o Moved filename completion code to filecomp.c.
o Change ver command to display email address to report bugs, and the
  web page address for updates.
o fixed so that it find_which returns NULL if filename is not
  executable (does not have .bat, .com, or .exe extension).  Before
  command would to execute any file with any extension. (opps!)

29 Jul 1998 (Rob Lake rlake@cs.mun.ca)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o changed date.c and time.c, and wrote datefunc.c and timefunc.c to
  impliment _dos_getdate, _dos_setdate, _dos_gettime and _dos_settime.
  This is the first of many steps to make the shell compatible under
  Pacific C.

28 Jul 1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Added CLS command.
o Put ifdef's around all commands and added include file config.h
  Now you can define exact what commands you want to include in
  command.com.
o Also added ifdefs for optional features: aliases, command history
  and filename completion.
o Added display of available internal commands and options at startup.


20 Jul 1998 (John P Price <linux-guru@gcfl.net>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Fixed bug in DATE.C.
o Fixed bug in LH.ASM.
o Separated commands into individual files.


19 Jul 1998 (Hans B Pufal) <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Preserve state of echo flag across batch calls.
o Implementation of FOR command


16 Jul 1998 (Rob Lake rlake@cs.mun.ca)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Added TRUENAME command.


16 Jul 1998 (Hans B Pufal <hansp@digiweb.com>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
batch.c
  A new version, implements CALL, ECHO, GOT, IF, PAUSE, SHIFT and
  BEEP. There is a stub for FOR but that's all.

cmdtable.c
  New file to keep the internal command table. I plan on getting rid
  of the table real soon now and replacing it with a dynamic
  mechanism.

command.c
  A new (improved ;) version. Conforms closely to MS-DOS specs.
  Cleaned up (and fixed) the redirection handler.

command.h
  Version D with changes. Look for the HBP tag.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMMAND.C/COMMAND.H:
o Now sets COMSPEC environment variable

o fixed wide display so that an extra return is not displayed when
  there is five filenames in the last line.
ENVIRON.C
