name: shift
de: Shift the arguments of a batch script
req: CMD_SHIFT

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: SHIFT
<LI>
EBNF: SHIFT DOWN
</OL>

DESCRIPTION:
Shifts the arguments of a <A HREF="!:batch">batch script</A> one
position up (first variant) or down (second variant).

<P>Within a batch script the automatic variables %0 through %9
are replaced by the script name and the first nine arguments.
This can be imagined as a window to ten arguments of the script.
SHIFT will allow to move this window of ten arguments towards its
end (up) or its start (down).

<P>After SHIFT has been executed, the former %0 is hidden and inaccessable,
%1 became %0, %2 became %1 a.s.o, %9 became %8 and the formerly hidden
tenth argument became %9.
<BR><CMD>SHIFT DOWN</CMD> reverses one SHIFT command.

<P>SHIFT can be called as many times as wanted, <CMD>SHIFT DOWN</CMD>
won't allow to underflow the very first argument.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1

If the batch script B.BAT:<BR>
CMD: @ECHO OFF
CMD: ECHO 0: %0
CMD: ECHO 1: %1
CMD: ECHO 2: %2
had been executed using:<BR>
CMD: B.BAT 1 2 3 4
it displays:
<PRE>B.BAT
1
2</PRE>
<BR>If a SHIFT command had been inserted as second line, the
same call displays:
<PRE>1
2
3</PRE>
