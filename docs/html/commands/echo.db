name: ECHO
de: Displays a string onto screen
see: TYPE
req: CMD_ECHO

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: ECHO [ ON | OFF ]
<LI>
EBNF: ECHO <<string>>
<LI>
EBNF: ECHO.
</OL>

When executing a <A HREF="!:batch">batch script</A>
each line is displayed to the console
before executing it by default. The first variant of ECHO enables or
disables this behaviour. To disable echoing the commands is equal to
prefix each line of a batch script with the Ad-symbol <CMD>@</CMD>.
<BR>If ECHO is invoked with no argument at all, the current echo status
is displayed.
<BR>When entered on an interactive command line the echo status controls
whether or not the PROMPT string is displayed.

<P>The second variant displays the specified
EBNF!: <<string>>
.
<BR>Note: Because of variant 1
EBNF!: <<string>>
 may not expand
to the single words <CMD>ON</CMD> or <CMD>OFF</CMD> without another
character.

<P>The third variant displays an empty line. No space must be
placed between the dot and ECHO.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: ECHO

Displays the current echo status, e.g. responding:
<PRE>ECHO is on</PRE>

EXAMPLE: 2
CMD: @ECHO OFF

Disables the echo status. Because the Ad-sign <CMD>@</CMD> disables the
echo status right for this line, this command disable echoing all the
next lines of a batch script and is not echoed to the console itself.
It is, therefore, best placed in the first line of a batch script.

EXAMPLE: 3
CMD: ECHO Just a text

Displays <TT>Just a text</TT>
