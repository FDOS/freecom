name: CD
de: Change current directory of a drive
see: DIR, CDD, PUSHD, DIRS MD RD CHDIR
req: CMD_CHDIR
opt: FEATURE_LAST_DIR

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: CD 
<LI>
EBNF: CD [ drive ':' ] path
<LI>
EBNF: CD '-'
</OL>

<CMD>CD</CMD> is 100% compatible with the <CMD>CHDIR</CMD> command; there
is no difference -- beside the spelling -- between them.

<P>The first variant shows the <A HREF="!:cwd">current working
directory</A> as absolute path.

<P>The second variant changes the <A HREF="!:currdir">current
directory</A> of the given drive.  If no drive is specified on command
line, the current directory of the <A HREF="chgdrive:">currently
selected drive (disk)</A> is changed.  This command does
<STRONG>not</STRONG> change the currently selected drive in opposite to
<CMD>CDD</CMD>!

<P>The third variant changes back into the last visited directory
<STRONG>and</STRONG> drive.  The commands <CMD>CD</CMD>,
<CMD>CHDIR</CMD>, <CMD>CDD</CMD>, and <CMD>PUSHD</CMD> save the current
working directory before performing the specified directory change; the
command <CMD>CD '-'</CMD> restores this saved directory. This command is
available only, if the feature LAST_DIR has been enabled during the
compilation of FreeCOM.

OPTIONS:
There are no options for this command.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: CD \freedos\help

Changes the current working directory of the currently selected drive to
the path <CMD>\FREEDOS\HELP</CMD>.

EXAMPLE: 2
CMD: CD c:\freedos\help

Changes the current directory of drive <CMD>C:</CMD>.

EXAMPLE: 3
Assuming the current working directory is <CMD>\FREEDOS\HELP</CMD> and
the currently selected drive is <CMD>C:</CMD>.

CMD: CD 

Displays <CMD>C:\FREEDOS\HELP</CMD>

EXAMPLE: 3
The command sequence, provided the first two worked successfully:<BR>
CMD: CD \FREEDOS\HELP
CMD: CD ..
CMD: CD -

changes first into the directory <CMD>\FREEDOS\HELP</CMD>, then into
its parent directory, which is <CMD>\FREECOM</CMD>. And finally
<CMD>CD -</CMD> changes back to <CMD>\FREEDOS\HELP</CMD>, because this
was the previous directory before previous <CMD>CD</CMD>-like command.
<P>Because <CMD>CD -</CMD> saves the previous directory, too, any
subsequent:
CMD: CD -
will switch between these two directories; until another directory is
changed to.
