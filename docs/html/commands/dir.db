name: dir
de: Displays the contents of the directory
see: mkdir, rmdir, chdir
req: CMD_DIR

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: DIR [{ options | pattern }]

<P><CMD>DIR</CMD> displays the contents of direcories and/or
the attributes of files, whatever the <ARG>pattern</ARG> specifies.
If no <ARG>pattern</ARG> is specified on command line, the current
working directory is displayed. The actual information displayed
depends on the specified options and is explained below.
<P>A <ARG>pattern</ARG> may contain <A HREF="!:wildcards">wildcards</A>,
which are expanded against both files and directories. To specify a
directory is essentially equal to write: <CMD>directory\*.*</CMD>.
<P>Unlike options patterns are performed in sequence, that means that
if two patterns are specified, first all entries matching the first one,
then all entries matching the second one are displayed;
<FONT SIZE=-1>instead of to display the matching entries intermixed</FONT>.

<P>Before parsing its command line DIR parses any <EM>option</EM> specified
by the environment variable <OPT>DIRCMD</OPT>.

STD_OPTIONS:
<UL>
<LI><OPT>/A</OPT>: (All) Wildcards are matched against System and Hidden
files, too.
<LI><OPT>/A**</OPT>: (Attribute) Wildcards are matched against files
with selected attributes set or clear. The argument
of the <OPT>/A</OPT> option is a sequence of:
	<UL>
	<LI><OPT>?</OPT> meaning: attribute <OPT>?</OPT> must be set, or
	<LI><OPT>-?</OPT> meaning: attribute <OPT>?</OPT> must not be set.
	</UL>
	<P>The following attributes, the <OPT>?</OPT> above, are supported:
	<UL>
	<LI><OPT>R</OPT> for: read-only,
	<LI><OPT>H</OPT> for: hidden,
	<LI><OPT>S</OPT> for: system,
	<LI><OPT>D</OPT> for: directory, and
	<LI><OPT>A</OPT> for: archive.
	</UL>
	<P>If the same attribute is specified twice within the same
	<OPT>/A</OPT> option, the last one superceeds previous ones; if
	more than one <OPT>/A</OPT> option is specified, the last one
	superceeds all previous ones.
<LI><OPT>/B</OPT>: (Bare) Displays the lines with the information of
files and directories only. The ones displaying the volume label,
the serial number, totals etc. are suppressed. In combination with
<OPT>/S</OPT> the absolute path of the files is displayed.
<LI><OPT>/L</OPT>: (Lower-case) Filenames are displayed in lower-case
letters rather than capitol ones.
<LI><OPT>/O</OPT>: (Order default) is a synonym of <OPT>/ONG</OPT>.
<LI><OPT>/O**</OPT>: (Order) Sort the entries displayed in a specific order.
	The following sort orders are supported:
	<UL>
	<LI><OPT>D</OPT> sort by last modification <B>d</B>ate (earliest first)
	<LI><OPT>E</OPT> sort by file <B>e</B>xtension
	<LI><OPT>G</OPT> <B>g</B>roup directories first
	<LI><OPT>N</OPT> sort by file <B>n</B>ame
	<LI><OPT>S</OPT> sort by size (smallest first)
	<LI><OPT>U</OPT> do not sort (<B>u</B>nsorted)
	</UL>
	<P>Each sort order, except <OPT>U</OPT>, may be prefixed by
	a hyphen to reverse the sort order. <OPT>U</OPT> effectively
	cancels any previous setting or specified sort order, e.g. to
	override an <OPT>/O</OPT> option from the <OPT>DIRCMD</OPT>
	environment variable.
	<P>If the same sort order is specified twice within the same
	<OPT>/O</OPT> option, the last one superceeds previous ones; if
	more than one <OPT>/O</OPT> option is specified, the last one
	superceeds all previous ones.
	<P><STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: The entries are cached within memory
	before displaying them; if FreeCOM runs short on memory, to sort is
	disabled completely or the entries are sorted in chunks only.
	<BR>Usually DIR can sort well over 1000 entries.
<LI><OPT>/P</OPT>: (Page) Page the output -- pause the display after
	issuing one screen-full.
<LI><OPT>/S</OPT>: (Subdirectories) Recursively display directories.
<LI><OPT>/W</OPT>: (Wide) Displays five filenames per line and suppress
the information about the file size, date etc.
<LI><OPT>/Y</OPT>: (Year) Displays a 4-digit year, rather than just two
	digits.
<LI><OPT>/4</OPT>: (4digit Year) is a synonym of <OPT>/Y</OPT>.
<LI><OPT>/LFN</OPT>: Enables to display long filenames at the end of a
	line in non-wide mode (<OPT>/W</OPT> not present), if available.
	<BR>This option is temporarily enabling a <STRONG>TESTING</STRONG>
	feature and may vanish in a future release of FreeCOM.
</UL>

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1

CMD: DIR
Displays the contents of the current directory, but ignore System and
Hidden files. The output may look like this:

<PRE>
!!todo!!
</PRE>

EXAMPLE: 2

CMD: DIR a* bb* *.txt
First displays all files, that begin with the letter <CMD>A</CMD>; then
all files, that begin with two letters <CMD>B</CMD>, are displayed and
at last all files with the extension <CMD>TXT</CMD>.

EXAMPLE: 3

CMD: DIR /w a* b*
CMD: DIR a* /w b*
CMD: DIR a* b* /w
Because the position of options is not significant,
all these examples behave the same way and display the matching files
in <EM>wide</EM> or also called <EM>short</EM> form, which may look
like this:

<PRE>
!!todo!!
</PRE>
