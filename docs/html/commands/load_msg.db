DESCRIPTION:

If enabled on compilation of FreeCOM, the <OPT>/MSG</OPT> becomes
available.

<P>If this option is present, when an instance of FreeCOM is created,
the FreeCOM messages are loaded into memory permanently. Otherwise,
the messages are loaded on demand and are removed from memory when an
external command is executed, in order to conserve memory.

<P>This feature may help to run FreeCOM on disk- and floppyless boxes.
