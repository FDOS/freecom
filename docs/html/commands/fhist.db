of FreeCOM, old command lines are storred in the history and can
be retrieved later using the key bindings of <TT>F3</TT>, <TT>F1</TT>
and the cursor Up and Down keys.
<BR>Without the command line history at most one line is cached.

<P>The command:<BR>
CMD: HISTORY
<BR>displays all cached command lines.

<P>The command:<BR>
EBNF: HISTORY number
<BR>resizes the amount of bytes reserved to cache command lines to
<ARG>number</ARG> bytes. Doing so all cached command lines are deleted.

<P>Each instance of FreeCOM maintains its own command line history,
which is initially inherited from the particular parent instance,
if any.
