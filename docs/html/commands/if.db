name: IF
de: Conditional execution of a command

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] EXIST file <<command>>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] ERRORLEVEL number <<command>>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] string '==' word <<command>>
<LI>
EBNF: IF [ NOT ] quoted-string '==' quoted-string <<command>>
</OL>

Conditionally executes the specified
EBNF!: <<command>>
. If the keyword
EBNF!: NOT
 is specified, the condition is negated, meaning, the
EBNF!: <<command>>
 is executed, if the condition evaluates to false.

<P>The first condition evaluates to true, if the specified <ARG>file</ARG>
exists. Wildcards are supported. On local file systems one can test for
character devices, too.

<P>The second variant evaluates to true, if the errorlevel is currently
assigned to a number greater or equal than the specified <ARG>number</ARG>.
Errorlevels are assigned when external commands terminates or via
CANCEL or QUIT.
<BR>Due to compatibly with other DOS shells FreeCOM does not check, if
the specified errorlevel is a number, but silently accepts any string.
This allows to use the so-called <EM>Benny levels</EM>, where you
can specify <CMD>HA</CMD>, <CMD>HB</CMD>, ... , <CMD>HZ</CMD> or
<CMD>xa</CMD>, <CMD>xb</CMD>, ... , <CMD>xz</CMD> instead of
<CMD>1</CMD>, <CMD>2</CMD>, ... , <CMD>26</CMD>. Some malformed
<A HREF="!:batch">batch script</A> use this syntax to make mapping of errorlevels to
drive letters <EM>more visible</EM>. See example 5.

<P>The third and four ones are true, when the left string is case-sensitively
equal to the string on the right side of the double equal sign.
Either side may be quoted by double quotes, though, if the right side
is <EM>not</EM> quoted, the first word is tested only.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: IF NOT EXIST c:\command.com ECHO There is no COMMAND.COM in C:\
<BR>Executes the ECHO command, if a file <CMD>C:\COMMAND.COM</CMD>
does <EM>not</EM> exist.

EXAMPLE: 2
CMD: IF EXIST c:\fdos\nul GOTO have_fdos_directory
<BR>Branch the interpretation of the batch script to the label, if
the file <CMD>C:\FDOS\NUL</CMD> exists. Because the filename <CMD>NUL</CMD>
corresponds to the character device <CMD>NUL:</CMD>, which always exists,
this test may be used to probe for the existance of the path
<CMD>C:\FDOS</CMD>, because all character devices are virtually present in
every directory of local filesystems.

EXAMPLE: 3
CMD: IF %1==name ECHO First argument is "name"
<BR>ECHO is executed, if the first argument of the current batch script
is <ARG>"name"</ARG> (without the quotes). <CMD>%1</CMD> may expand to
any string, even with embedded whitespaces, but without an embedded
double equal sign. Also, metacharacters included within the argument
are evaluated.

EXAMPLE: 4
CMD: IF "%1"=="first name" ECHO First argument is "first name"
<BR>ECHO is executed, if the first argument of the current batch script
is <ARG>"first name"</ARG> (without the quotes). <CMD>%1</CMD> may expand
to any string, even with embedded whitespaces or an embedded double
equal sign or metacharacters.

EXAMPLE: 5
EBNF: <<program>>
CMD: SET drv=
CMD: FOR %%Z IN (A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z) DO IF ERRORLEVEL H%%Z SET drv=%%Z
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 27 SET drv=
CMD: IF "%drv%"=="" goto error_no_drive_letter
<BR>Assuming that
EBNF!: <<program>>
 is setting the exit code to 1..26 for the drive letter, e.g. when
searching for RAMdisks, this code snippet assigns the drive letter to
the environment variable <CMD>drv</CMD> or unsets the variable on error.

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The following code is equal to the above one
and fully compatible to all shells:
EBNF: <<program>>
CMD: SET drv=
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 1 SET drv=A
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 2 SET drv=B
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 3 SET drv=C
<BR>...  <BR>
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 25 SET drv=Y
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 26 SET drv=Z
CMD: IF ERRORLEVEL 27 SET drv=
CMD: IF "%drv%"=="" goto error_no_drive_letter
