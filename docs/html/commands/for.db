de: Repeat a command
req: CMD_FOR

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: FOR '%' letter IN '(' { word | pattern } ')' DO <<any command>>

Executes <EBNF><<any command>></EBNF> for several values assigned to
the variable <ARG>letter</ARG>. The values are read strictly left to right
from the <ARG>word</ARG>s and <ARG>pattern</ARG>s enclosed in
parenthises; where <ARG>pattern</ARG>s are words containing
wildcards and are replaced by all matching filenames.
<P>Any occurence of a percent sign <TT>%</TT> and the specified letter
is replaced by the current value of the FOR loop.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: FOR %z IN (*.*) DO copy %a a:

Performs a <CMD>COPY xyz A:</CMD> command for each file in the current
directory. Its behaviour is equal to <CMD>COPY *.* A:</CMD>

EXAMPLE: 2
CMD: FOR %z IN (a?b*.TXT) DO CALL batch arg %z

Executes the batch script <CMD>batch.bat</CMD> for each file matching
the pattern <TT>A?B*.TXT</TT> located in the current directory. Within the
script, the automatic variable <ARG>%1</ARG> always expands to the constant
argument <ARG>arg</ARG>, whereas <ARG>%2</ARG> expands to the filename
of the current loop.

EXAMPLE: 3
CMD: FOR %a IN (1 2 3 4 5) DO ECHO %a

Is equal to the command sequence:<BR>
CMD: ECHO 1
CMD: ECHO 2
CMD: ECHO 3
CMD: ECHO 4
CMD: ECHO 5

Because these words do <EM>not</EM> contain no wildcards, they are <EM>not</EM>
matched as filenames.

EXAMPLE: 4
CMD: FOR %g IN (1 2 3*) DO ECHO %g

Performs the commands:<BR>
CMD: ECHO 1
CMD: ECHO 2

and the ECHO command for each file in the current directory, that has no
extension and which name starts with the digit three.
