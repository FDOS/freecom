SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: REN <<source>> <<destination>>

Renames the source file(s) into the target file(s). See also: \REF{wildcards}

<P>The
EBNF!: <<destination>>
 must not contain any path specification, the
EBNF!: <<source>>
 file is renamed within the directory it is currently located in, see
example 2 below. Any wildcards used within
EBNF!: <<destination>>
 are replaced by the corresponding character of the source filename,
see example 4 below.

STD_OPTIONS:

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1

CMD: REN file1.txt file2.txt

Renames <CMD>file1.txt</CMD> into <CMD>file2.txt</CMD>

EXAMPLE: 2

CMD: REN path\file1.txt file2.txt

Renames <CMD>path\file1.txt</CMD> into <CMD>path\file2.txt</CMD>

EXAMPLE: 3

CMD: REN path\file*.txt *.bak

Renames all files located within directory <CMD>path</CMD> with extension
<CMD>.txt</CMD> and which filename is beginning with <CMD>file</CMD>,
such as <CMD>file.txt</CMD>, <CMD>filea.txt</CMD> and <CMD>file99xx.txt</CMD>,
into <CMD>*.bak</CMD> files.

EXAMPLE: 4

CMD: REN *.DAT A*.*

Renames all files located within the current directory with extension
<CMD>.DAT</CMD> into files by replacing the very first character of
the filename by the letter <CMD>A</CMD>, all other characters, the
file extension and path are remain unchanged.

EXAMPLE: 5

CMD: REN *.TXT ??b*.bak

Renames all files located within the current directory with extension
<CMD>.TXT</CMD> into files by replacing the <EM>third</EM> character of
the filename by the letter <CMD>B</CMD> and the file extension to
<CMD>.BAK</CMD>, all other characters and the
file path are remain unchanged.

<P><STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> If the source file name consists of one
character only, the second question mark in the destination pattern
is ignored, hence, e.g. the file <CMD>A.TXT</CMD> is renamed into
<CMD>AB.BAK</CMD> by this example, what is <EM>incompatible</EM> to
MS COMMAND v6.22 <FONT SIZE=-1>(maybe others, too)</FONT>, which
embedds a space as second character making the file inaccessable,
but what is exactly the same behaviour of the same MS COMMAND's COPY
command.
