name: MEMORY
de: Display the internally used memory
req: CMD_MEMORY

SYNOPSIS:
EBNF: MEMORY

DESCRIPTION:

Displays the useage of internal memory of FreeCOM.

<HELL>Note</HELL>: The internals of FreeCOM are currently under heavy
construction, the actual output might vary heavily from this example.

EXAMPLES:
CMD: MEMORY

may display this:
<PRE>
Environment segment    : max  1200 bytes; free     8 bytes
Context segment        : max  2304 bytes; free  2252 bytes
        Aliases        : limit  1024 bytes, current     5 bytes,     0 items
        History        : limit   256 bytes, current    34 bytes,     2 items
        Directory stack: limit   256 bytes, current     5 bytes,     0 items
        Last dir cache : used      0 bytes,     0 items
        Swapinfo       : used      0 bytes,     0 items
Heap                   : free 482080 bytes
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>The <TT>Environment segment</TT> is the storage area, the environment
variables are storred in. It may be changed passing the <OPT>/E</OPT>
option to FreeCOM.
<LI>FreeCOM stores several internal information into the
<TT>Context segment</TT>; the aliases - modified by the ALIAS command -,
the history - displayed using the HISTORY command, accessed by pressing
the cursor Up/Down keys on command line -, the directory stack - displayed
with the DIRS command and accessed using the PUSHD and POPD commands -,
the last directory - accessed with the <CMD>CD -</CMD> command -, and,
finally, some internal command used by the low-level swap interface of
FreeCOM.
<LI>The <TT>heap</TT> is the storage area FreeCOM can allocated
memory from itself. This value is useful for FreeCOM developers
mostly.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><TT>max</TT> specifies the maximum amount of bytes allocatable
within this storage area.
<LI><TT>free</TT> specifies the unused bytes within this storage area.
<LI><TT>limit</TT> specifies the maximum amount of bytes allocatable
for the particular information within the area.
<LI><TT>current</TT> specifies the amount of bytes currently allocated
for the particular information.
<LI><TT>items</TT> specifies the number of items storred
for the particular information, e.g. how many directories have been
pushed onto the stack using PUSHD.
</UL>
