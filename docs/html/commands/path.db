name: PATH
de: Display or set the search path
req: CMD_PATH

SYNOPSIS:
<OL>
<LI>
EBNF: PATH
<LI>
EBNF: PATH [ '=' ] { path : ';' }
<LI>
EBNF: PATH;
</OL>

Displays or assigns a new search path.

<P>The first variant displays the currently active search path.

<P>The second one assigns the specified paths to the search path.
The leading equal sign, if present, is ignored.

<P>The third variant empties the search path.

<P>When FreeCOM searches for an external command or a batch script, which
has no path specified, it is search for in all the directories specified
in the search path. If the current directory <CMD>.</CMD> is not mentioned
in the search path, it is searched through first.

EXAMPLES:
EXAMPLE: 1
CMD: PATH c:\fdos\bin;c:\tools;d:\others\bin;bin
<BR>If FreeCOM is to execute an external program, e.g. <CMD>XCOPY</CMD>,
FreeCOM will search for the program in the following directories in the
specified order, the first program file found is executed:
<OL>
<LI>the current directory
<LI><CMD>C:\FDOS\BIN</CMD>
<LI><CMD>C:\TOOLS</CMD>
<LI><CMD>D:\OTHERS\BIN</CMD>
<LI><CMD>BIN</CMD>
</OL>
<BR>Note: Because the last directory specification is a relative one,
rather than an absolute one, the program is searched for in the
sub-directory <CMD>BIN</CMD> of the current directory.
