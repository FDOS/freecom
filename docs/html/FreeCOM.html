<BODY>
<H1>Introduction</H1>

FreeCOM is a:
<UL>
<LI><B>C</B>ommand <B>L</B>ine <B>I</B>nterface,
<LI>(user) shell and/or
<LI>COMMAND.COM replacement
</UL>for DOS. It has been spawned as part of
<A HREF="http://www.freedos.org">FreeDOS</A>, a project that aims to implement
a GNU GPL'ed DOS.

<P>The main duty of FreeCOM is to prompt the user <A HREF="#cmdline">to enter
commands</A>, which
are interpreted, processed directly by FreeCOM or executed as executable
files.

<P>Those commands processed by FreeCOM directly are called
<A HREF="#icmds"><EM>Internal Commands</EM></A>.

<P>Non-internal commands, which cannot be processed by FreeCOM directly,
are called <EM>External Commands</EM>,
because FreeCOM will search for files equally named as typed-in.

<P>Besides to implement certain commands FreeCOM offers some
<A HREF="#features">features</A>.

<H1><A NAME="icmds">Internal Commands</A></H1>
Internal commands will be processed by FreeCOM directly, they are available
to the user without presence of any external files, in fact they hide
External Commands named equally.

<P>The synopsises of the <A HREF="cmd.html">internal commands</A>
are described in a style derived from <A HREF="#ebnf">EBNF</A>.


<P><HR><P>
<H1>Appendix</H1>

<H2><A NAME="#ebnf">EBNF</A></H2>

Documents encode the synopsis of the commands with operators derived from
EBNF (<B>E</B>xtended <B>B</B>ackus-<B>N</B>aur <B>F</B>ormula).

<H3>Type setting</H3>

Depending on different meanings characters are set into various shapes:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
	<TH>Name
	<TH>Meaning
	<TH>Example
<TR>
	<TD><TT>terminal</TT>
	<TD>characters to be enterred on command line or displayed by
		the computer;EBNF: &quot;terminal symbols&quot;
	<TD><TT>ECHO</TT>
<TR>
	<TD><TT>'string'</TT>
	<TD>The quotes remove the metafunction of the enclosed characters
		in order to specify EBNF operators as terminal symbols.
		EBNF: &quot;terminal symbols&quot;
	<TD><TT>'|'</TT>
<TR>
	<TD><B>bold</B>
	<TD>operators that constructs portions together;
		EBNF: &quot;operators&quot;
	<TD><B>|</B>
<TR>
	<TD><I>italian</I>
	<TD>placeholders for arguments, which are explained in the description;
		EBNF: &quot;non-terminal symbols&quot;
	<TD><I>varname</I>
</TABLE>

<H3>Operators</H3>

The EBNF  uses the following operators:
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
	<TH>Symbol
	<TH>Meaning
<TR>
	<TD><B>|</B>
	<TD>alternative; use either left or right token
<TR>
	<TD><B>()</B> 
	<TD>parenthizes enclose tokens limiting the range of <B>|</B>
<TR>
	<TD><B>[]</B>
	<TD>brackets enclose optional tokens, thus, they may appear zero or
		one time; they also limit the range of <B>|</B>
<TR>
	<TD><B>{}</B>
	<TD>curly brackets enclose repitive tokens, which may appear one or
		more times; they also limit the range of <B>|</B>
<TR>
	<TD><B>{ : }</B>
	<TD>as the normal curly brackets, but any repitive tokens are delimited
	by the token(s) right of the colon; for instance:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>{</B> <I>file</I> <B>:</B> <TT>'+'</TT> <B>}</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	is the same as:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>file</I> <B>[{</B> <TT>'+'</TT> <I>file</I> <B>}]</B>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	and applies to:
	<UL>
	<LI><I>file</I>
	<LI><I>file</I> + <I>file</I>
	<LI><I>file</I> + <I>file</I> + <I>file</I>
	<LI><I>file</I> + <I>file</I> + <I>file</I> + <I>file</I>
	<LI>...
	</UL>
<TR>
	<TD><B>&laquo;   &raquo;
	<TD>is a placeholder for an arbitary string of terminal symbols, which
		further syntax is described by the enclosed text in English
		natural language.
<TR>
	<TD><B>::=</B>
	<TD>assigns a meaning (right side) to a non-terminal symbol (left side);
		for instance<PRE>
	<TT>DIR</TT> <B>[ {</B> <I>option</I> <B>|</B> <I>filespec</I> <B>} ]</B>
	<I>option</I> <B>::=</B> <TT>/</TT> <B>(</B> <TT>A</TT> <B>|</B> <TT>B</TT> <B>|</B> <TT>C</TT> <B>)</B><BR></PRE>
		Any occurance -- only one here -- of <I>option</I> on the right
		side of an <B>::=</B> or where no <B>::=</B> is present at all is
		to be replaced by the right side of <I>option</I><B>::=</B>.

</TABLE>

<P>Unless modified by above mentioned operators a sequence of tokens specifies
that each token must be present exactly one time in exactly that order.<BR>
Note: For the sake of clearness, spaces are inserted between tokens. These
spaces do <STRONG>not</STRONG> mean that a space is allowed at this place!
Also, the fact that no <B>_</B> is present does <STRONG>not</STRONG> mean that
at this place is none allowed. It is assumed that the reader will find
the places where optional spaces are valid either by "doing" or by reading the
examples.
