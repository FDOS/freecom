Known Bugs

When switching to a drive with no disk in it, it doesn't notice, and
you get garbage.

Reported Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From: Steffan
 o The DEL access()/stat() stuff is still broken (included in my last
   buglist report)
 o in FOR command redirects are lost.

From: John P. Price
 o History.  If you typed a long command line (one that wraps to the
   next line), then if you go back and forth with the up and down
   keys, it scrolls the screen in a weird way.

 o command.com uses too much memory!

 o make filename completion search for exe and com files that match if
   you press tab while typing the first word (the command).  Make
   this a compile-time option.


From: Charles Dye
 o DIR displays incorrect year values for dates 1-1-2000 or later.
   Perhaps it would be better to always display years as four
   digits?

 o CD followed by a drive letter (but no directory name) should
   display the current directory for the specified drive.
