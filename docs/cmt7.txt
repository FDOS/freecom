Permanent data storage within external memory block

FreeCOM utilizes several information that need to keep the same
when it gets reloaded. The current implementation, esp. ALIAS,
command line history, directory stack and batch nesting level,
maintain their own data within a module-local (aka static)
data structure that is usually dynamically extended into the heap.
ALIAS and batch processing use single linked lists, history and
dirstack use a single memory block.

During a swap of FreeCOM this information must be restored to its
values, though, it need not be replicated exactly the same. For instance,
if the "last command line" returns the same line, it is uninteresting
where this information comes from.

When this information is stored external to FreeCOM right away,
there is no need to take special care about when FreeCOM swap, but
it will require more time as "external" usually means that these
locations cannot be addressed with near addresses, which are the default
and fastest ones.

There is already one data that is maintained external to FreeCOM,
the block of environment variables. This block must be present in
its format and syntax, because 3rd party tools are silently allowed
to modify its contents.

An environment segment is a simple structure, though, mainly implemented
to store character strings within it:

<name1>=<value1>\0
<name2>=<value2>\0
...
<nameN>=<valueN>\0
\0

Per convention "<name>"s are printable characters except the equal sign
itself.

ALIASes are by nature already expressed in this syntax.
Entries of the command line history and the directory stack can also
be expressed as such strings easily.

Even the batch nesting could be easily written as a string, but it would
require a rather heavy transforming between both forms.

However, there need to be a way to distinguish all different kinds of
information stored within such pseudo-environment. Under the
prerequisite that almost all 3rd party tools honor the convention that
names are constructed out of printable characters, non-printable
characters look fine; the low-level functions already implemented and
used by FreeCOM to access an environment segment don't care at all
about the name of the variable as long as it does not contain no
equal sign or NUL character.

Some information, for instance how many entries the history
or the directory stack contains, could be located in this block
as well, though it is not really required, because FreeCOM already
utilizes a so-called "static" context, which primarily serves as
interface between the higher and lower portions of the swapping
process, but had been designed to include other data as well since
its beginning. The main reason to split permanent information across
two structures, the so-called static and dynamic contexts, arise
from the fact that the amount of and even the maximal user-specified
size of such information changes heavily at runtime.

To have the static context firmly rooted in the memory of the systems
allows to place vital functions within there, e.g. the Critical
Error handler, without to worry about what happen if to resize the
context fails. The static context will reference to the associated
dynamic context, which, if lost, is rebuilt by FreeCOM easily, though,
with 100% loss of all information stored within there.

To place all above mentioned information into the same dynamic context
has the great advantage that all of them are located in one place, so
the overhead to retreive their location and the management overhead,
if they would be located in different memory blocks, is reduced.
But doing so bestows FreeCOM with the management to verify that
all information is allocating at maximum as many space as allowed by the
user.

The slightly modified format of the dynamic context looks like this:

<tag><name>=<value>\0
...
\0

<tag> is a single character that specifies the kind of information
stored in this line.

<tag> has been choosen like this:
\1 -> execution context
\2 -> entries of the command line history  (A)
\3 -> entries of the directory stack (A)
\4 -> last directory (B)
\5 -> swapinfo
\6 -> arguments %0..%9..%# currently in effect
\8 -> internal variables
\9 .. ' ' -> reserved for future use
'!' .. -> alias

To let the aliases allocate all the remaining tags has the slight
side effect that the syntax of aliases is the same one as of
environment variables; and because the syntax of the commands
SET and ALIAS is nearly the same one as well, both commands can
share a lot of code. Here, SET is to ignore all entries with a
non-printable first character.

Theoretical notes:

+ The lowlevel functions to maintain an environment segment are known,
	so it is possible to rely on this or that implementation, e.g.
	new entries are always appended to the end of the environment
	and existing entries are changed on place. That means if a variable,
	e.g. with an empty name or unknown tag is create at the very
	beginning of the environment, FreeCOM can rely on that the value
	of the variable is located at easily calculatable addresses.
	Though, the value must not contain no NUL characters.

+ The memory block must be located in its own DOS memory block, because
	the lowlevel functions to rely on information located in the MCB
	preceeding the environment segment -- esp. to aquire the length
	of the segment from.

+ Because the dyn context is splitted into multiple sections (see below
	in section "Batch nesting information"), it is possible to furtherly
	separate the aliases from the other strings, what would make the
	handling of the aliases _exactly_ the same as the one of the
	environment variables, with the only exception that another segment
	is in use.
===

At this time not every instance of FreeCOM maintains a static context,
hence, there is no dynamic context by default.
So for this time, the values that should normally go into the static
context are implemented as global variables and are saved/restored
into the static context on swap.

Batch nesting information

This is a rather old name for all information necessary to describe
in what execution state FreeCOM is located in currently. It includes
batch scripts, FOR loops, pipes, multi-command lines, redirections.

By its nature, FreeCOM enters a new execution state by hitting
specific commands and leaves them, when these commands terminate.
As a DOS-specific hack, if a batch script is called without the
CALL instruction, all previous execution states must be terminated
and the script is invoked as if typed in on command line interactively.

So, these states can be visualized as a stack using push and pop
operations to enter or leave the current state; the information
assocated with each particular state describe what to do in order
to fetch the next command in detail.
This information will be called execution context below.

To overvome the disadvantage of the transformation of the execution
context to and from environment format, it is stored in binary
format. In order to do so, the dynamic context is splitted into
two portions: first (at the lowest address) the string area and
the execution contexts last, strings are allocated bottom-up,
whereas contexts are allocated top-down; see below figure.

low address
	MCB of dynamic context (16 bytes)
|	1st string in environment-like format
|	2nd string in environment-like format
|	... string in environment-like format
v	last string in environment-like format
	unallocated space
^	most current execution context in binary format
|	previous execution context in binary format
|	... next execution contexts in binary format
|	first (eldest) execution context in binary format
high address
	MCB of next DOS memory block

Because the strings shall be maintained by the environment handling
functions, they need to be surrounded by a structure that looks
like a MCB, except some function not used by FreeCOM the environment
functions use the size field of the MCB only, in order to calculate
the unused space of the segment. So, if the dynamic context starts
with a sub-MCB of its own, the environment functions of SUPPL can be
faked to work easily, like this:

low address
	MCB of dynamic context (16 bytes)
	sub-MCB for string area
|	1st string in environment-like format
|	2nd string in environment-like format
|	... string in environment-like format
v	last string in environment-like format
	unallocated space part of sub-MCB (may be empty)
some paragraphe boundary
	unallocated space of this paragraphe not used by 1st ctxt (may be empty)
^	most current execution context in binary format
|	previous execution context in binary format
|	... next execution contexts in binary format
|	first (eldest) execution context in binary format
high address
	MCB of next DOS memory block

Whenever a context is pushed, the "some paragraphe" boundary is moved down
and the "size" field of the sub-MCB is reduced; on a pop operation the
boundary moves up.

This way the space of the dynamic context can be allocated without much slack
space. Because only the size field is used by the environment functions,
all the remaining 14 bytes of the sub-MCB may be used for some purpose.

Normal MCB fields:
offset	size	meaning
0		1		MCB type 'M' or 'Z'
1		2		MCB owner (segment of PSP)
3		2		MCB data size in paragraphes
5		11		reserved / unused

Fields of sub-MCB:
offset	size	meaning
0		1		MCB type to cope with enabled debugging of SUPPL [== 'Z']
1		2		owner of this dynamic context (for future use)
3		2		data size in paragraphes [always != 0]
5		1		offset of 1st context in "some paragraphe" [0..15] (*)
6		10		reserved for future use

(*) The current execution context starts at:
	MK_FP(FP_SEG(subMCB) + data_size + 1, offset)

The format of the execution contexts is byte-aligned flat binary with this
structure:
byte	context ID
word	size of context excluding this header
....	body

The body has as many bytes as mentioned in the "size" field of the header.
Then the next context follows immediately.

The following section describes the individual contexts in the following
syntax:

'?' short description:
optional_repetition_of_field	type_of_field	meaning_of_field
long description and notes

types:
ASCIIZ: '\0'-terminated string
BOOLEAN: one-byte value 0 == false; else == true
BYTE: one-byte value
WORD: two-byte value
DWORD: four-byte value

If the repetition is omited, "1" is assumed.



The context ID describes, what kind of information is storred there; there are:

'I' Interactive input:
<no arguments>

'B' Batch contexts:
DWORD	position within file to read the next line from
DWORD	number of lines already read from file
ASCIIZ	absolute filename of batch file

When such context is popped, the file is opened, seeked to the mentioned
position, one line is read. Then the line number is incremented, the
position is updated, the file is closed and the line is executed. Until
a line has been read, the file is kept open, e.g. skipping labels and
empty lines.


'F' FOR context #1:
ASCIIZ	remaining patterns
ASCIIZ	variable name
ASCIIZ	command

If the variable name is specified without any leading percent sign, it is
treated as a normal environment variables and is also storred there.
Otherwise, it is a single-letter variable and must be preceeded by as
many percent signs as enumerated in the string.

'f' FOR context #2:
21	BYTE	bytes required to call next findnext()
WORD	offset of variable name within F-context
WORD	offset of command within F-context
ASCIIZ	prefix to found filenames
A f-context is always preceeded by a F-context
variable name - see 'F' context.

'C' Command context:
ASCIIZ	command

This context contains a command that is to be executed when popped.
NOTE: This context is particularily useful in conjunction with the
internal commands and "::=" (see CMT3.TXT and ICMDS.TXT).

'c' non-ignore Command context:
ASCIIZ	command

As the C-context, but is not ignored when CANCEL'ling or EXIT'ting.

'E' Exit context:
Demands to terminate FreeCOM. Though, if FreeCOM was started with /P,
it will hang infinitely.

'e' no-Exit context (aka Keep-Running context):
If stdin != EOF, an I context will be pushed; otherwise this context
behaves as an E context.
