Batch file processing

This document discusses the features and functionality of the
batch file processing. It does not include help or explanation
for the batch language itself.

In the following "batch" files and the like are called "scripts"
or "shell scripts" most of the time; the author assumes that most
people running DOS/FreeCOM will associate the COMMAND batch language
with this term.

C> is an icon of the command line prompt an user is to enter commands at.
It shall only visualize the interactive prompt and _not_ the particular
drive C:.

A '===' at the first column represents a section header.
A '==' sourrounds file listings and, sometime, output of programs.

=== Invoking Shell Scripts

Variant 1:

Shell scripts are invoked like any command:

SCRIPT arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 ... argN <in-file >out-file

The arguments and the I/O redirection directives are optional, of course.

Batch scripts are identified by the extension .BAT, it is currently
not possible to execute a batch script without this file extension.

In this variant, however, empties the execution context, what means that
any formerly nested script are "forgotten". In addition, FOR loops are
destroyed, too.

Variant 2:

In order to nest script they must be invoked via the CALL command:

CALL SCRIPT arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 ... argN <in-file >out-file


The arguments and the I/O redirection directives are optional, again.
Also, the scripts must have the file extension .BAT.

Unlike to invoke scripts without CALL, the current position within
the current script is preserved and the execution returns to the next
command following the CALL command when the CALL'ed script finishes.
FOR loops are destroyed nonetheless.

EXAMPLE:

== BATCH1.BAT
echo In Batch1 - arg1 = %1
== BATCH2.BAT
@echo off
call batch1 first
echo second
call batch1 third
==

Invoking script BATCH2 from command line:

C> batch2

would output:

==
In Batch1 - arg1 = first
second
In Batch1 - arg1 = third
==

Because there is no old execution context on command line, the user may
invoke script BATCH2 with or without CALL; but if BATCH2.BAT would read:
== BATCH2a.BAT
@echo off
batch1 first
echo second
batch1 third
==

Invoking the modified script BATCH2 from command line:

C> batch2a

would output:

==
In Batch1 - arg1 = first
==

Because to invoke a batch script without CALL destroys any former
execution context, hence, the shell simply forgot where to return to
when BATCH1.BAT ends.

=== Accessing Arguments

The argument passed to a script are accessable through the automatic
variables: %1, %2 through %9 (there is no trailing second percent sign).
Variable %0 returns the name of script in the same way it has been
written on invokation, e.g.:
== BATCH.BAT
echo %0
==

C> batch
batch
C> BATCH
BATCH
C> batch.bat
batch.bat
C> .\batch.BAT
.\batch.BAT

Arguments may be separated on command line with: whitespaces, commas,
semicolons ';' and equal signs '='. There is no known quotation mechanism.
E.g.:
== BATCH.BAT
@echo :%1: :%2: :%3: :%4: :%5: :%6: :%7: :%8: :%9:
==

C> batch 1 2,3;4=5 6+7
:1: :2: :3: :4: :5: :6+7: :: :: ::

The tenth and later arguments are not accessable directly; to fetch them
the command SHIFT must be used. Each SHIFT increments a "shift level" by
one and when using "%n", it is replaced by the "n + shift_level"'th
argument, e.g.:

== BATCH.BAT
echo %0
SHIFT
echo %0
SHIFT
echo %0
==

C> batch 1 2 3
batch
1
2

Please note that %0 is effected by SHIFT, too.

There is no upper limit for SHIFT. If "n + shift_level" references to a
non-existant argument, it is replaced by an empty string, aka by nothing.

=== Noisiness / Echo State / Process Options

There are some batchfile process options that effects the way batchfiles
are processed, e.g.:
ECHO -> display the command line before executing it
TRACE -> prompt if to execute a command line
SWAP -> swap FreeCOM out of memory during executing the command

All these settings are peristent options: They get a default setting on 
startup, then they can be changed and keep their setting until a) changed
again or b) the execution drops to the interactive command line again, in
which case they get their default setting again.

For instance:
== BATCH1.BAT
ECHO
CALL batch2.bat
ECHO in batch1
ECHO
== BATCH2.BAT
@ECHO OFF
ECHO in batch2
ECHO
==
will display:
C> ECHO
ECHO is ON
C> CALL batch2.bat
in batch2
ECHO is OFF
in batch1
ECHO is OFF

The ECHO state is still "OFF", when the script BATCH2.BAT exits and returns to
BATCH1.BAT. The first two lines are ECHO'ed.
The batch language do also include single line modifications of several
options, such as if '@' prefixes a line, this line is not ECHO'ed, but
this setting may not effect a called batch file, e.g.:
== BATCH.BAT
ECHO
==
C> @batch
should tell that ECHO is ON, although the invocation of BATCH.BAT is not
ECHO'ed itself.

However, the possibility to control the swapping of FreeCOM is an extension
to the CALL command and could be interpreted differently in that that
== BATCH1.BAT
CALL /S batch2.bat
prg1.exe
== BATCH2.BAT
prg2.exe
==
the swapping is enabled for prg2.exe (and the whole BATCH2 script), but no
longer in BATCH1, thus, to execute prg1.exe FreeCOM would remain in memory.
To interprete this option is a "local" one, rather than a global one as ECHO
seems more logical and less incompatible.

Therefore FreeCOM implements a global set of options, which are "currently"
active, and provides a push/pop mechanism to keep previous versions of the
them.
When a batch script is invoked, the current options are pushed and the
global settings are overwritten by the defaults ones for batch script
execution. Once the last batch script has terminated, these options are
poped, thus, automatically resetting the global options by the pushed ones.

So, changes of the global options during execution of a batch script are
made local for batch scripts, even if one chains from one script to another
by invoking a script without CALL.

Also, craftly used the push/pop feature can provide the possibilty to
change such options during a called batch script only, as intended with
the SWAP option. This might be the basis for 4dos's SETLOCAL command.

Though, if the push/pop feature is used, there is one implicit pop when
a batch script terminates and if one chains to script, all currently
active scripts are terminated. So if one calls:
== BATCH1.BAT
CALL /S batch2
prg1.exe
== BATCH2.BAT
prg2.exe
batch3.bat
== BATCH3.BAT
prg3.exe
==
PRG1.EXE is never invoked, because to chain from BATCH2 to BATCH3 terminates
both BATCH2 and BATCH1; when invoking PRG2.EXE swapping is enabled; but
when invoking PRG3.EXE swapping has been resetted to its default value,
because to terminate BATCH2 and then BATCH1 causes to pop the O-context
created by CALL /S.
