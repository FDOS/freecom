Contributions are welcome!

Currently the best way to submit a patch is via a pull request (PR) on GitHub - see https://github.com/FDOS/freecom

Discussion and patches may also be done via the FreeDOS developer mailing list or by attaching a patch to an issue on GitHub.


Most wanted changes are:
  - translations, fixing any that may need updating or adding new languages
  - bug fixes, see Issues on GitHub site and bugs on Sourceforge https://sourceforge.net/p/freedos/bugs/
  - improvements or compability fixes, i.e. new or update existing commands to better match MS COMMAND.COM or 4DOS

Thank you.
