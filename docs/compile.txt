Compile notes:

1) Setup TC++ v1.01 (see www.freedos.org, Links page for a reference to
Borland's museum site).
2) Configure COMMAND.MAK and STRINGS\FIXSTRS.MAK, esp. CC_BASE_PATH
near the top of the files to reflect where you installed TC+ to.
3) Run MAKE -f command.mak

You will find two executables in the FreeCOM directory:
COMMAND.EXE and COMMAND.COM.
The .COM file is the stand-alone application, which includes the
strings etc, whereas COMMAND.EXE is the pure executable without the
strings table for instance. For debugging you must use the .EXE
file.


General information:

To compile this version of command.com, you have to add the suppl
directory to your list of include directories so that the compiler
can find the header files located there.

The library suppl_s.lib was built with the suppl library version 2.7
pre-release 2000/07/20. See the SUPPL subdirectory.
