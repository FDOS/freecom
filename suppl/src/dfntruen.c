ob(ject): dfntruename
su(bsystem): dfn
ty(pe): H
sh(ort description): Return the truename of a given filename
he(ader files): 
lo(ng description): Returns the truename of a given filename as returned
	by the DOS API function 0x60. The filename must not exceed the length
	of \tok{DFN_FILENAME_BUFFER_LENGTH} bytes.\par
	The possibly only useful function in which \tok{dfntruename()}
	should be used is to determine if two files are actually the same
	physical file although they have different logical filenames, e.g. assume
	the file \tok{C:\FREEDOS\SUBST.EXE} exists and one has created the
	logical drive letter \tok{Z:} by the following command:
	\tok{SUBST Z: C:\FREEDOS}. One could access the same \em{physical}
	file via two different logical path specifications:
	\enum \tok{Z:\SUBST.EXE}, and
	\enum \tok{C:\FREEDOS\SUBST.EXE}.
	\endlist
	\tok{dfntruename()} applied to both path specifications would
	return the only physical access path used by the DOS kernel.\par
	\em{But beware!} The truename must not be used as a function to fully-qualify
	a filename. There are at least two cases when that fails:
		\enum		\tok{JOIN A: C:\LW-A}\newline
			Now the call
			\tok{dfntruename("C:/lw-a/file")} results into \tok{"A:\\FILE"},
			but drive \tok{A:} is not accessable at all!
		\enum Networked drives, e.g. CD-ROM drives and LAN drives, does not
		follow the standard naming. Most of them (if not all) follow
		the UNC standard. For example:\newline
			Assume drive \tok{F:} is a Novell Netware drive created by:\newline
				\tok{MAP ROOT F:=SERVER/VOLUME:PATH1/PATH2/PATH3}\newline
			the call \tok{dfntruename("f:\\file")} would return
				\tok{"\\SERVER\\VOLUME\\PATH1\\PATH2\\PATH3\\FILE"}.\par
			Windows 9x/NT can handle UNC filenames, but this results in
			much slower access time, because Windows 95 globs the filename
			through the "network environment" driver each time such name
			is used.
pr(erequistes): 
va(lue): NULL: on failure (OS error code)\item else: pointer to dynamically allocated
	filename
re(lated to): 
se(condary subsystems): 
in(itialized by): 
wa(rning): The returned filename \em{cannot} be used to generate a
	fully-qualified pathname.\par
	The only useful thing to do with the result is to test, if two filenames
	point to the same physical file. One can think of this function as it
	would return a string generated of the device and i-node number of the
	file in Unix (symbolic links resolved).
