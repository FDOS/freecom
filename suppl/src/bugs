o All environment functions, except env_matchVar(), are case-sensitive! Thus
	env_findVar(0, "temp") will fail, because normally all DOS environment
	variables are in upper-case.
	Well, this is, of course :-), not a bug but a feature. Just use the
	env_matchVar() to adjust the variable's name prior using it.

o Because Micro-C does not have neither ungetc() nor feof(), Feof()
	simulates an ungetc() via fseek() and assumes always true for
	FILE* pointers in write mode.

o The control break catcher terminates the process using the program's
	exit() function. If the catcher is activated when the process is
	not currently active, e.g. a child is currently running, this
	should confuse DOS & application crashablely.
