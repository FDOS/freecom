#
# The critical error (criter) handler receives some information
# from the kernel about what error condition happens, generates some
# human friendly message from it, requests the user's opinion about
# how to proceed and, finally, returns to the kernel.
#
# The human friendly message is generated using one of the following
# templates:
# BLOCK_DEVICE (for criters on block devices)
#  Error %1 drive %A: %2 area: %3
# -and- CHAR_DEVICE (for criters on character devices)
#  Error %1 device %A: %3
#
# Two-character sequences, which first character is a percent sign '%',
# are placeholders for other information:
# %% -> a single percent sign
# %1 -> either READ or WRITE, depending on what kind of operation
#  caused the criter
# %2 -> the kind of area the criter took place on DOS, FAT, ROOT, or DATA
# %3 -> the actual error string; these are the strings associated to
#  a number 0 through N, and must correspond to the number passed in
#  lowbyte(DI) to the criter handler (see RBIL INT-24 for details)
# %A -> drive letter (for block devices); name of device (character devices)
#
# Below the line describing the error the user is prompted for the action
# to proceed. This line is dynamically constructed depending on which
# action are available at all. The full line may look like this:
#  (A)bort, (I)gnore, (R)etry, (F)ail?_
#
# The individual words are defined by ABORT, IGNORE, RETRY, FAIL. They
# should indicate which user response keys is associated with them;
# suggested is to use the first letter and enclose it in parenthesises.
# The delimiter ", " can be defined with DELIMITER and is the same
# for all slots.
# The "? " sequence is defined by QUESTION.
# The order of the actions is fixed and cannot be customized.
#
# With each action a number of user response keys must be associated.
# They can be enumerated with the KEYS_ABORT, KEYS_IGNORE, ...
# strings. Because the key is searched in the same format as returned
# by INT-16-00, both upper and lower case must be specified and
# certain special keys cannot be used.
#
# The individual error strings are defined by the #: lines, where
# the hash sign '#' refers to the number the kernel passes to the
# criter handler. The UNKNOWN string is displayed for all error
# numbers not specified.
#
# NOTE #1: The percent rule applies to _all_ criter strings!
# NOTE #2: Each string occupies exactly one line.
# NOTE #3: Any leading or trailing whitespaces are removed. Prefix the
#  first or suffix the last whitespace with '%.' (one percent sign and
#  one dot). This sequence is removed from the string totally.
# NOTE #4: To embed any character use: %&## (one percent sign,
#     one ampersand and exactly two hexa-decimal digits)
