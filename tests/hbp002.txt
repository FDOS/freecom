OK, here is my implementation of the FOR command, files changed :

   BATCH.C
   BATCH.H
   FOR.C


There is a problem running form BATCH files. Formthe command line
type in something like:

	for %%a in (a bb ccc) do echo %%a
  or
        for %%a in (*.c) do echo %%a


Put it in the next release and I'll work on fixing the batch issue.
