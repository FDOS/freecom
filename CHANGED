add: Slovenian translations from freedoslocal (Matej Horvat)
add: Turkish translations from freedoslocal.

fix: [bugs:#192] FOR %i IN (*.*) do @ECHO %i does not work
fix: [bugs:#209] The shell doesn't display any error if exec fails.
     It will now say "EXE file corrupt" if the .exe file has a bogus header.
chg: Reduce ifdef's for GCC, using new ia16-elf-gcc functionality.
chg: Use cglobal and cextern macros in asm files for globals.
fix: Use last-fit dosalloc for copy&dir buffers to work well with large model
fix: Plug memory leak in and around comResFile().
fix: _dos_allocmem takes a pointer to unsigned, not unsigned long.
fix: Wrap dprintf macro into do { ... } while (0);
fix: Use only libc stdio in DEBUG build, not printf from clib.
chg: Remove no longer used tempfile/rmtmpfile.
fix: cgetchar_timed and eliminate its call to fputmc.
chg: Replace fputmc calls by more direct memset/dos_write calls.
fix: non-small (debug) model compilations for Turbo/Borland.
chg: Compile debug version in medium memory model instead of large.
fix: debug version (large model); enable for watcom.
chg: Create and use sfn_creat() and use instead of dos_creatnew()
fix: lfn_creat needs to truncate files that already exist.
fix: hang for batchfiles that do not end with an EOL character.
     This fixes a hang with Rugxulo's metados.img.
v0.84pre4
fix: spelling, by Anders Jonsson <anders.jonsson@norsjovallen.se>
fix: Edits to Swedish translation file, by Anders Jonsson
fix: Make echolib.bat compatible with cmd.exe (Tom Ehlert)
fix: Fix build for GCC-compiled load_icd.exe (Bart)
fix: parsefnm failures and cleanup other inline asm for OW and GCC (Bart)
fix: revert change keeping context alwyas on heap (caused out-of-memory) (Bart)
fix: replace use of inline asm lcall/call for GCC with plain C calls (Bart)
v0.84pre3
fix: Make sure that ds=ss in XMSexec call (Bart)
The newest ia16-elf-gcc floats ds inside functions and with the inline
asm doesn't know it's a function call (Bart)
chg: fmemcpy now compiles properly with ia16-elf-gcc (remove workaround) (Bart)
chg: Use GNU Make instead of OW wmake to compile with ia16-elf-gcc (Bart)
chg: Build strings without needing to create/remove the subdirectory (Bart)
chg: Move xmssave and some related variables to near transient data
This is possible since the resident code no longer references those
Be careful to not write to any transient data after the save to XMS (Bart)
chg: Fix "TODO make XMSsave two structures in order to drop this subroutine"
(Bart)
chg: Make XMSexec function near and move 80 resident code bytes to transient
section. (Bart)
chg: fix xms-swap TODO: first_time either 04ah or 049h --> no jumps (Bart)
chg: xms-swap: move residentCS from cs: to ds: (Bart)
fix: Stack size for OW needs to be 4K instead of default 2K.
This matches Turbo C's default, and allows for some large stack
users with LFNs. (Bart)
chg: Reduce heap memory by only keeping the necessary rest of the command line.
(Bart)
chg: Keep the context permanently on the heap via realloc, to reduce
fragmentation. (Bart)
chg: Properly patch the heap size for Open Watcom
The memory layout for OW is different from Turbo C.
For Turbo, heap is below stack, but for OW it's the reverse.
Hence OW keeps the data segment much more minimal by default.
There is however a default sbrk increment of 8096 set by
_amblksiz. If we set that to 6K instead the heap will stay
at that size, so TSRs are loaded beyond that point
(for non-XMS-SWAP that is, with XMS-SWAP it's completely
different) (Bart)
chg: getEnv: remove static pointers, caller responsible for free.
Eliminating the 3-pointer dance and free-ing the environment
variable pointer as soon as possible reduces heap fragmentation. (Bart)
fix: Fix farwrite and hence copy for Turbo/GCC (Bart)
fix: "dir" output for dates with our own printf. It supports %02u but not %.2u.
Those produce the same result though (Bart)
chg: port to ia16-elf-gcc (Bart)
fix: kswap_p is a _seg * pointer so we need MK_SEG_PTR for compilers without
_seg (Turbo C 2.01, OW). Otherwise the critical error handler is not installed
correctly for non-xms-swap builds. (Bart)
chg: Use "add si, byte 10" so old and new NASM generate the same opcodes (Bart)
fix: Use proper prototypes on enum{File}Resources callback function (Bart)
chg: allow Linux cross-compilation, port build utils to GCC-Linux (Bart)
fix: Fix ren for files without extensions (passes NULL ptr for ext) (Bart)
fix: Fix LOADHIGH for compilers without _seg pointers. Use FP_SEG
instead of casting the pointer to unsigned, as _seg is defined to far on
compilers without _seg (e.g. Watcom) (Bart)
fix: IF EXIST should auto-fail critical errors due to empty drive (Tom & Jeremy)
add: %CD% as alternative to %_CWD% (Tom)
fix: Use screen height 25 when 0 returned as current height, from Mateusz
Viste, bug #131 see http://sourceforge.net/p/freedos/bugs/131/ (Jeremy)
chg: Merged fcompl1 and fcompl2.c to filecomp.c (Bart)
chg: Untangle findfirst/next/close definitions to make them more explicit (Bart)
chg: Consistently use dos_open/dos_close/dos_read/dos_write, etc
The problem with _open, _read, etc. is that they mean different things
to Turbo than for OW: Turbo _open is like _dos_open but OW _open is an
alias for open (Bart)
chg: Eliminate open() in favor of _open/_creat/dos_creatnew (Bart)
chg: Eliminate fgets(), replacing with _read() (Bart)
chg: Use backspaces instead of gotoxy calls to clear a command line (Bart)
chg: Use _write for all printf style writes in prf.c and for putc(har).
Remove fflush and setbuf calls (Bart)
chg: Eliminate fputs everywhere except for prf.c (Bart)
chg: Eliminate read() by using _read() everywhere (Bart)
chg: Remove references to fopen / fcloseall for non-debug builds (Bart)
chg: Use open/read/close instead of fopen/fread/fclose everywhere (Bart)
fix: EnumFileResources function arguments to all use handles instead of
streams (Bart)
fix: Fix loadModule: it should use an int fd for a handle instead of a FILE *.
(Bart)
chg: replaced all text mode write()s by binary _write()s to save RTL usage
space (Bart)
chg: farread/farwrite cleanup of DOS r/w's (Bart)
chg: Use handle I/O instead of stream I/O for resources to save space (Bart)
chg: Change geninterrupt emulation to use intr() instead of int86x() for
consistency (Bart)
chg: Centralize LFN functions for mkdir/rmdir/chdir (Bart)
fix: Support precision flag and size/precision from argument list in abbreviated
printf function, to fix "dir /lfn" (Bart)
fix: Don't truncate when not necessary for LFN opens. Works around an FD kernel
bug were truncating a 0-byte file caused an error (Bart).
fix: "copy con file" (Bart)
fix: COPY: trailing /a and /b options only apply to the last (destination)
file, not globally, when concatenating, "/a" is the default. (Bart)
chg: Replace stream i/o for COPY by simpler handle i/o, so fileno doesn't need
to be used all the time.  (Bart)
chg: Use BIGcopy() for both ascii and binary copies. ASCII just means to check
for Ctrl-Z, don't mess with line endings, so do that manually using fmemchr.
When eof is detected, no more reads are needed. (Bart)
fix: COPY: The /B switch should switch devices to raw mode (see nansi.sys
documentation). Fix errors given for "copy [/a|/b] file.txt con".  (Bart)
chg: Use small printf() from the kernel source with a few modifications to do
some buffering. Saves 3.5K in RTL code for OW. (Bart)
fix: exit() needs to be overriden for OpenWatcom as well as Turbo C. (Bart)
fix: Fix direct _seg pointer casts for Open Watcom (and also Turbo C 2.01)(Bart)
fix: Fix size of LFN in struct locffblk, and make sure the ffblk structs are
packed (Bart)
fix: Fix devopen in OW using stdarg.h and proper prototypes (Bart)
fix: Fix xms-swap for Open Watcom (Bart)
fix: Set stdout to unbuffered for Watcom as it is by default for Turbo C (Bart)
fix: Use stdarg.h to avoid messing with prototypes in, and fixing Open Watcom'
use of env_replace (Bart)
fix: Update build system to support Open Watcom. Introduce config.b/config.bat
like in the kernel source to be able to configure make/wmake locations (Bart)
fix: ISR/dir.h/stpcpy/string/?etverify/parsfnm related changes for OW
compatibility (Bart)
chg: Use IREGS/intrpt instead of struct REGPACK/intr everywhere for OW
compatibility. Similarly, USEREGS simulates geninterrupt (Bart)
fix: Avoid Turbo C specific use of sizeof in preprocessor expressions (Bart)
fix: Adjust makefiles to be compatible with TC 2.01's very limited MAKE utility
(no redirection) (Bart)
fix: Fix compiler warnings (Bart)
chg: Handle .obj dependencies for suppl instead of rebuilding every time (Bart)
chg: Prune unused files from stripped-down suppl (Bart)
chg: Remove duplicate .h files from suppl source (Bart)
fix: Do not compare (signed) to ' ' but use iscntrl() - otherwise,
FIXSTRS may chop trailing non-ASCII (eg Russian) words away (Eric Auer).
fix: Fixed compilation completely with Turbo C (Blair).
fix: Got rid of all '//' comments (Blair)
fix: Support for BC (Blair)
fix: Fix for compiler oddities (Arkady).

add: Add option to compile to support switch character instead of hardcoded '/'
(Blair)
add: The new SET /E feature. (Blair)
fix: Fixed long filename handling in DIR. (Blair)
fix: COPY uses static-size buffers now to prevent known problems with dynamic
allocation. (Blair)
fix: Improved PATH handling routine (Arkady).
fix: Fixed (hopefully) bug in %PATH% parsing routing and A:/B: random accessing bug (Blair).
fix: Fixed bug where a directory could be found in %PATH% parsing (Blair).
chg: Added Polish translation, updated French&Italian translation (Blair).
chg: Made RD/MD/CD more buggy-lfn-implementation friendly (Blair).
chg: Removed usage of CLIB perror function and reduced executable size by nearly
1 kb.  Since perror was only used in ren and del, and only two possible errnos
exist, the function can be minimized, and also as an added advantage, the
errors that were printed can now be translated (Blair).
v0.84pre2
add: exec sets CMDLINE if command-line is longer than 125 characters; if setting CMDLINE fails, so does exec. (All DJGPP-compiled apps and various others support CMDLINE for passing parameters)
chg: Size optimizations
