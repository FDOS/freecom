Implementation and verification status of expExec branch.

Abbreviations:
ctxt: context
dyn: dynamic (context)
ec: execution context
env: environment
var: (environment) variable

1. Internal commands
1.0. General
	All internal commands except the ones mentioned below
	have not been changed as they are not effected by the
	execution context
	- Working
1.1. CANCEL, QUIT, EXIT
	- Working
	- Set the the global flags doCancel, doQuit, doExit.
		Those flags are actively evaluated by most ec handlers.
1.2. FOR
	- Working
	- Added: FOR parser before the variables are expanded (and therefore
		before anything is done to the command line at all). This allows
		several known quirks of the MS COMMAND FOR command, such as
		repeated (rather than applied) redirections: FOR .. DO echo >file
	- Added: Multicharacter FOR variables are accepted and behave as
		normal env vars.
	- Added: Batch files _not_ executed via CALL cause to quit FOR loops.
	- Env vars are expanded by the normal command line parser rather than
		FOR itself, that means that FOR variables are active within
		CALL'ed batch scripts.
	- BUG?: Wildcarded, but non-matching parameters are passed unchanged
		to the command.
	- BUG?: If the first attempt to validate a FOR statement fails, the
		command line is expanded, meaning:
			C> FOR %a IN *.*) DO echo %a
		fails, because the left "(" is missing; cmd_for_hackery()
		returns, the command line gets expanded into:
			C> FOR a
		, because "%a IN *.*) DO echo %" is considered a variable name.
		This leads to confusing error messages.
		a) cmd_for_hackery() would need to cope with embedded redirections,
			if errors are to be displayed there.
		b) There is a logical clash between "%a" is to be treated as FOR
			variable spec or a variable to be expanded.
	- BUG?: If hackery FOR is found, the commmand is exapnded once, otherwise
		the command is expanded twice: first before parsing FOR, second
		when a match is found and the command gets executed.
1.3. CALL
	- Working
	- Sets the local "called" flag.
	- Handles options: /S and /N, which modify the local "swap" flag.
	- Does _intentionally_ work within FOR statements and pipes
1.4. GOTO
	- Working
	- Sets the local flags "rewindBatchFile" and "gotoLabel".
	- BUG?: Multiple words are ignored.
1.5. ECHO
	- Working
	- Modifies the global flags "dispPrompt" or "echo", depending on
		if issued from interactive command line.
1.6. SHIFT
	- Working
	- Modifies global flag "shiftlevel".
1.7. MEMORY
	- Added: Display of new tags of the dynamic context: Arguments, Internal
		flags and internal variables.
	- Added: Display of largest available block within heap.
	- Added: Display of largest available block of DOS memory.
1.8. ARG
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Modifies the global flags "shiftlevel" and "base_shiftlevel" and
		removes old entries of the dynamic context with tag CTXT_TAG_ARG.
	- Used to reset the state of batch script arguments to the status of
		before calling a batch script.
1.9. DISPLAY_FLAGS or !
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Used to display the global and local flags
1.10. DISPLAY_NLS or @
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Used to display the NLS information currently in effect
1.11. ICMDS
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Used to enable or disable internal commands
1.12. IVAR
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Used to modify internal variables, such as special FOR variables
1.13. HISTORY
	- Working
	- Added: To change the lower limit of history buffer
1.14. FD
	- Working
	- Used to reset a JFT entry to the state previous to the current
		redirection
1.15. DISPLAY_ARGS
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Displays the Batch script argument stack (tag #6)
1.16. DISPLAY_IVARS
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Displays the Batch script argument stack (tag #7)
1.17. DISPLAY_EXEC
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Displays the execution context stack
1.18. DISPLAY_STATUS
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Displays the current status (includes the other DISPLAY_* functions,
		MEMORY, ALIAS,& HISTORY)

2. Internal functions
2.0. General
	- Working
	- Newly added feature
	= common syntax: %@NAME(arguments)
	- processed by command line parser expanded env vars
2.1. IVAR
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Return the value of an internal variable
	- Used within pipes to store the name the temporary file
2.2. TEMPFILE
	- not verified
	- Newly added
	- Create and return the name of a temporary file
	- Used within pipes
2.3. VERBATIM
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Quotes text against expansion by the command line parser
2.4. BATCHNAME
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Returns the absolute filename of the currently active batch script
2.5. BATCHLINE
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- Returns the current line number of the currently active batch script

3. Command line parser (aka scanner)
- Working
- Expands special FOR variables, too
- Added: internal functions (%@-syntax)
- No line limit (except unused memory in heap)

4. Enhanced command line editor
- Working, except lines larger than one screenful
- Fixed: multiline command lines
- No line limit (except unused memory in heap)

5. Command line executor (aka parser)
5.0. General
- Working & verified for internal & external commands and batch scripts;
	pipes and redirections are verified for internal commands and batch
	scripts; not working: redirections and pipes in conjunction with swapping
- Modified into a state-driven automaton; the state is storred into the
	dynamic context, the "execution context" portion at its end.
	The ec is organized as stack, to most current item (topmost) is located
	near the beginning of the dyn context, the end is located at the end of
	the dyn context.
- Several stages:
	-- run_exec_context()
	1) acquire current state and retreive a command line from the actual
		ec handler
	2) probe for hackery FOR statement
	3) expand env vars (command line scanner)
	-- parsecommandline()
	4) expand aliases
	5) apply trace mode
	-- parseExpandedCommand()
	6) extract redirections and split pipes
	7) apply redirections for the current command (1st in pipe)
	-- docommand()
	8) check for forced internal command "::="
	9) run command line extension MUX-AE
	10) check for internal command -- run it, if so --> break stages here
	-- execute()
	11) check for "change drive": X:  command
	12) search for command through ".:%PATH%" search paths
	13) Initiate batch file processing if absolute filename ends in ".BAT"
	14) otherwise: call external command
5.1. Redirections
- Working verified for input, output and pipes; no support for swapping
- Supported redirections:
	">>&>"	- stderr into file (append)
	">>&"	- merging stderr & stdout into file (append)
	">&>"	- stderr into file (overwrite) 
	">&"	- merging stderr & stdout into file (overwrite)
	">>"	- stdout into file (append)
	">"		- stdout into file (overwrite) 
	"<"		- stdin from file
	"|&"	- pipe merging stderr & stdout
	"|"		- pipe stdout only

6. Dynamic context
- Working
- Allows to change the boundaries of history etc. at run-time
	[Though: Implemented for HISTORY only currently]
- Layout:
	-> start of DOS memory block
		+ string-based information in env-style memory block
		+ binary information of ec
	-> end of DOS memory block
- Stores: History, Aliases, Dirstack, Execution Context, Batch script
	arguments, last dir, internal variables, swapinfo, size-variant
	flags (such as ICMDS settings)

7. Static context
- Working as before, needs to be redesigned for code-sharing; part
	of CRITER module
- Stores: Hooks to Critical error and ^Break handlers, size-invariant
	flags, such as the global flags

8. Global flags
- Working & verified
- storred as part of the static context
- if there is a corresponding local flag, the global one holds the default
	value of the local flag, which is copied before the read-function of the
	current item of the execution context is activated. So the read-function
	can modify them.
8.1. dispPrompt
	- Working
	- see echo
8.2. echoBatch
	- Working
	- see echo
8.3. swap
	- Working
8.4. canexit
	- Working
8.5. interactive
	- Working, but not verified/used
8.6. called
	- Working
8.7. trace
	- Working
8.8. debug
	- Working
8.9. persistentMSGs
	- Working, as its behaviour wasn't changed at all
8.10. errorlevel
	- Working
8.11. base_shiftlevel & shiftlevel
	- Working, verified as part of batchfile processing
8.12. batchlevel
	- Working
8.13. echo
	- Working
	- Its actual state depends on the current mode, if a batch file
		is active or the interactive command line
8.14. ignoreCBreak
	- Working
	- Newly added
	- cbreak() function will always return "NONE", ignoring the
		actual ^Break status and all the doExit/Cancel/Quit macros.
		Used to let hidden commands ignore do* status and make sure
		they are executed.

9. Local flags
- Working
- Storred in global variables, their initial values are determined by the
	internal status of FreeCOM or the value of certain global flags
9.1. swap
- Working
- Defaults to global "swap", modified by CALL
9.2. echo
- Working
- Defaults to global "echo", modified by a "@" preceeding input line
9.3. rewindBatchFile & gotoLabl
- Working
- Default to zero, modified by GOTO
9.4. traceMode
- Working
- Default to /Y, modified by a "?" preceeding input line
9.5. interactive
- Working
- Default to global "interactive"
9.6. called
- Working
- Default to global "called", modified by CALL
9.7. doExit, doCancel, doQuit
- Working
- Default to zero, synchroneously set by EXIT, CANCEL or QUIT respecfively,
	asynchroneously set by ^Break handler, cleared by ec handlers.
9.8. implicitVerbose
- Working
- derived flag

10. External handlers
10.1. Critical error handler
- Working (not changed), but not verified for current release
10.2. ^Break handler
- Working, still a pull-technology
- FreeCOM polls the status of ^Break from the global variable ctrlBreak
	and sets doCancel or doQuit, if a ^Break occured.

11. Reload support
- Not working -- not verified for current release
- still external service

12. NLS
- Included and used and is usually working; not verified is the outcome
	of a non-working NLS
- BUG: portions of FreeCOM will always use NLS, even with FEATURE_NLS disabled

13. Overall
- static and dynamic contexts must be handler together, not as two individual
	chunks of external resources as now; this will certainly ease the error
	condition handling and reduce malfunctioning
